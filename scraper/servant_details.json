She really loves strong men!Not going against her own desires at all, she made many men her own while alive.The owner of the magic sword Caladbolg, Fergus, was one of her lovers.She also really loves treasures, and for that reason she triggered a great war with the entirely of Ulster as her opponent and commanded the Connacht troops while driving her own chariot.",

Won't forgive, won't forgive, won't forgive, won't forgive, won't forgive! Absolutely, not him!\"C\u00fa Chulainn of Ulster! By the name Medb, the lover and ruler of all men, I swear!

Under the command of this top lady, the militarily inferior Ptolemaic Egypt grew into one of the greatest economic powers in the world.",

After all, Caesarion outlived Cleopatra for at least a few days.However, Caesarion only had 9 years-old when he lost his life. Thus, the de facto \u201clast pharaoh\u201d - who ruled the country and fought against fate - was Cleopatra.",
            "Bond 2": "In public, she would behave arrogantly as a queen; but regarding her own personal matters, Cleopatra restrains her eccentric attitude and becomes a well-raised, prudent and cool high-class young woman.In simple terms, her attribute would be high-handed, sadistic kindness.Despite having sadistic tastes, she is kind. Although she is an extreme sadist, this does not mean that she gains pleasure at tormenting others.She does not disparage others in order to feel good herself, but rather she just have that sort of character.",
            "Bond 3": "While she behaves as a queen, her true nature is that of a honorable person who understand decorum, pays attention to her surroundings and attempts to preserve harmony.When foreign delegations arrived, her usual practice would be to disparage at them with words such as:\u201cIn my country, I myself am the absolute standard, and those unattractive are no different from slaves - no matter who they might be.Heh, better prepare yourselves, you inferior or substandard fouls!You can relax to your hearts\u2019 content here!All while, at the same time, being concerned with the delegates\u2019 health and rewarding them with the greatest hospitality.Maybe because of that, countless were the delegates who requested audiences just to be disparaged by Cleopatra, or something.",

Such passion and state of mind made even the winds that stirred the Mediterranean Sea look dazzling, but...He died. Despite the unification of the Mediterranean world laying right before his eyes, he ended up being assassinated. Leaving behind their son Caesarion.And then, there was one person who appeared before Cleopatra as she was lost in tears. A man who announced he would protect Cleopatra and the Ptolemaic Egypt: the Roman general Antonius.After having loved her country and people, as well as two men - Caesar and Antonius of Rome - in the end, she committed suicide.",
            "Bond 5": "She got close to two men, and died.It was love. The result of her feelings. As if it could have been the product of self-interest or the likes!--- However, let alone in later generations, there were unanimous rumors about how \u201cthat devilish woman seduced the Roman generals\u201d even in her own time. As a result, upon becoming a heroic spirit, she acquired an existence as a \u201cseducing woman endowed with devilish beauty\u201d in this present-day in which she manifested as a Servant.Even still, as her dignity---She only gets close to wonderful gentlemen.A person possessing a sincere nature and, just like the two men she once fell in love with, whom she can believe would not regret dying together with her; only such a person may utterly seduce her.",

My wish would be for my son Caesarion to be acknowledged by his father Caesar or for Caesar to lose weight.That's right... Lord Caesar... the last time I saw him was the figure of him heading out to Rome from Alexandria. He was a man of such incomparable charm and handsomeness that there was no comparison in Rome or Egypt...... How exactly did he end up being assassinated!?!?",

He sentenced twenty thousand of the opposing turkish army to impalement, but as he carried out such severe punishment, the nobles turned against him.At the very end, he was assassinated by his own people, the nobles of Walachia.",

Before its irregularity and offensiveness, the Turkish soldiers once heralded as gallant warriors completely lost their morale.It's said even the one called the Conqueror, the brave Mehmed II left the words, \"I do not fear any form of man, but demons are another story,as he pulled his army out.The fields of impalement at the time were three kilometers in length, one kilometer in breadth. Even after the Ottoman Empire eventually occupied Walachia, it is said this trauma is what caused them to recognize the state's right of self-governance.",

Ebih, increasing her divine might with each step, and in the end grabbed a hold of the mountain range\u2019s summit and thrusted a spear on the central part of its leyline, causing the Ebih mountain range to collapse.Based on such an anecdote, she pulls off a deed that even Gods fear: upon employing the Noble Phantasm, she warps to Venus and takes possession of its concept by means of management rights, loading it and firing it from Maanna\u2019s magazine as a conceptual planet.Also called Jebel Hamrin Breaker.",

It was proof that her love for her children outweighed her love for her husband.However, the gods then turned their blades on Tiamat. Tiamat wailed and raged, birthing eleven new Magical Beasts to oppose the gods.At the end of the war, Tiamat and the Eleven Beasts were destroyed.The gods split Tiamat\u2019s corpse in two and used them to form the heavens and earth. It is said that this ritual created the world of humans.",

(The Inner World. Lifeless imaginary number space, not a parallel universe.)Because the Earth\u2019s ecosystems were established, Tiamat, who randomly designs life, was no longer needed.The goddess became nothing more than an obstacle to the process by which life forms acquired the intelligence determined by the planet.Since then, Tiamat has been waiting in the world of imaginary numbers for her chance to return to Earth.",

Instead, it is her children\u2019s role to mop up the human race.Furthermore, this Skill is an expression of the holder\u2019s presence across all of space-time, rendering her immune to attacks by methods such as time travel paradoxes, and canceling out all instant death attacks as well.Self-Modification: EXTiamat can remold her own Saint Graph using the Black Sea of Life.Her body can grow from its standard Saint Graph (Femme Fatale) into that of a dragon over 60 meters in length.Once Tiamat becomes a dragon, attacks against her of A++ rank or lower are nullified.",

This Skill raises the user\u2019s Strength.It is at about the highest possible level. This is why Tiamat\u2019s Strength is that of a titan when she makes the black mud into her body and manifests in her draconic form.",

And yet, she was in middle of a slumber.Setting aside wherever it was caused by Merlin\u2019s magecraft, she awoke from that sleep due to the attack from Chaldea and set out to eradicate mankind in accordance with her instincts.While there is resentment\u30fbhatred\u30fbsadness for being discarded as someone who had already served her purpose, this is also a deed of indulging in the \u201cjoy\u201d of once again repainting the Earth\u2019s ecosystem and having everything come back to the mother.Her Class was determined by this true nature described above.The goddess of Genesis and the likes are nothing but fake names.Deserted by humans, this is one of the most rejected great disasters in human history.Its name is Beast II.One of the seven human vices, the beast carrying the principle of \"regression.\"",
            "Extra": " It is impossible to confirm if Tiamat possesses anything resembling a personality.Perhaps she lost her intellect, or perhaps she never had one, to begin with. Either is acceptable.The only meaning of her existence is to create, raise, and love her children. Thus, she set out to make war against humanity for declaring that it has no need for her.It is the functioning of an extremely primitive system: \u201cIf I do not exterminate modern humanity, I will be killed.\u201dMotivations\u30fbAttitude towards the MasterOne of seven billion.

I shall grant it\uff63. Rather than gold or political power, Solomon sought wisdom more than anything.God was satisfied. For that answer itself was proof that he had the qualifications to attain \uff62True Wisdom\uff63.When he woke up, Solomon had ten rings inserted on both hands. They were the proof of the wise man recognized by God.Later, those would be called Ring of Solomon, the source of the magic that employs angels and demons.",

Although serious, he is not earnest and is constantly living at 80% power.He properly ascertained people, properly established laws and properly governed the country. Despite lacking in vigor, he was loved and respected by the masses as a wise, gentle king who was full of love.......Yet, none of those traits came from Solomon\u2019s own will.Having been ordained as a king from the moment he was born, Solomon had no choice but to hear the voice of God and act accordingly.His psyche is dispassionate and (having been deprived of the freedom to sympathize with the joys and sorrows of people) inhuman.",
            "Bond 5": "After becoming human, Solomon finally acquired the human nature called romance.At his roots, he is a realist and a pessimist.Despite uttering wishful thinkings as a mood-maker, he seems somewhat shameless due to inwardly thinking of them as pipe dreams.While he likes humans, because of his chicken side that \u300edoes not want to see something sad\u300f, he maintains a superficial socializing with anyone. In exchange, he can get along with anyone.An archetypal \u300eeverybody\u2019s friend\u300f.He has a bad habit of, when caught in a dilemma, ending up choosing to either \u300estick to observing without making any decisions\u300f or \u300erunning away\u300f so that \u300ethe status quo is preserved\u300f.Since Romani himself is reflecting on such weakness of his, if someone in his surroundings were to just say a word - \u300ePlease, do your best\u300f - he will somehow get a hold of himself and show a decisive judgment fitting of the king of magic.Incidentally, because the first impression that any Servant ends up getting about Romani is \u300eI don\u2019t get the reason, but he is at fault here\u300f, they unconsciously complained at him.The only ones who did not find fault at him were those who were not Servants, crackpots and Berserkers that do not perceive evil as evil.",
            "Extra": "The Time of Parting has Come, He is the One who Lets Go of the WorldRank: DType: Anti-UnitArs Nova.The first Noble Phantasm of King Solomon.Rather than Goetia, this is a Noble Phantasm possessed by the true King Solomon.A poem of farewell in which he relinquishes of all the exploits accomplished, all the miracles performed, all the magics established until then.Upon invoking his Noble Phantasm, Solomon sends all the graces bestowed by God back to heavens and loses the eyes that gaze at the world.The result is King Solomon\u2019s death.From another angle, this also means the self-destruction of the 72 demons.It can also be described as a safety device prepared by Solomon, in order to destroy \uff62magic\uff63 when it becomes an evil for humans in the distant future.When this is employed as a Noble Phantasm, all traces of King Solomon are extinguished from this world.\u2500\u2500\u2500even from the Throne of Heroes."

The \u2018Musashi\u2019 in this world is a man? And also extremely famous? What a surprise!As you see, the person herself has a relaxed, open attitude that never gets worked up.Having no particular interest in victory or prestige, yet sloven with alcohol, a sucker for money and weak against free food.However, all those who confronted and were beaten by her in battle said this in the end:---a vibrant Heavenly Flower.

Shinmen Munisai built a dojo of jutte techniques in the Miyamoto village of the Yoshino district, and Musashi would later call himself \u201cMiyamoto\u201d due to having this land as his hometown.He left behind many anecdotes and went through numerous battles against martial artists upon reaching adulthood - especially during the ten years of his 20s. Those famous bouts are even now seen as a staple of the entertainment industry.However, the truth behind the episodes of these ten years of battle is mostly wrapped in mystery and there are strong suspicions about them being mere fiction.",

Weak to flattery. A banchou disposition that loves a brawl. Although she has a sense of justice, she never preaches to be righteous herself.Fundamentally a carefree wandering vagabond, but she becomes ruthless when coming across scenes such as \u201ca one-sided massacre\u201d, \u201ctrampling on people\u2019s dignity, convictions for fun\u201d or \u201cstealing my food when I\u2019m hungry\u201d.",

You might say that this is something that she places her entire existence on her gaze and projects it onto her objective.In Musashi\u2019s case, her Heavenly Eye is pointed only at the deed of \u201ccutting a certain place\u201d.For example, once she has decided to \u201ccut the opponent\u2019s right arm\u201d, she will server said right arm by taking any and all measures.As a result, her attack becomes the optimal answer for a slash - \u201ca sword stroke without anything pointless, which makes even time and space yield\u201d.A power to take all the \u201cmeasures for the sake of achieving an objective\u201d and \u201cnarrowing them down to one\u201d.You might as well say that this is an extremely unique set of mystic eyes, which confines the naturally infinite futures into \u201cjust a single\u201d result.",

Only a swordsman who has reached the infinite mental state can perceive this.The Book of Five RingsRight before death, Musashi compiled the mental state he attained during his lifetime, his cultivated techniques, into one book.Divided into the five volumes of Earth, Water, Fire, Wind and Void, this book was the culmination of the human being called \u201cMusashi\u201d.The Book of Five Rings gives an outline of the Niten Ichi-ryu and explains its ideology as an art of war in the Book of Earth, explains concrete techniques on the Book of Water, talks about the art of war in the dimensions of tactics and strategy on the Book of Fire, and - just like the above-mentioned - explains the fundamental understanding of the Niten Ichi-ryu by means of a repudiation of other schools on the Book of Wind.Finally, it has been said that Musashi\u2019s own understanding about \u201cemptiness\u201d, as well as the above-mentioned technique of \u201cconfrontation\u201d, has been written down on the Book of Void."

In short, \"Luck EX\" is the unquantifiable, unachievable \"miracle\" that she once attained.",

BB understood that she was an illusion of a single night.BB does not label herself as \"a tool to save humanity\", but as a \"devil that bothers humanity, and sometimes helps it\".\"That's why, coming to like me is useless you know? No matter how lovey-dovey you become for BB, I'll never be caught \u2665she says while looking triumphant.",

In other words, they indicate that this individual is the antagonist of the enlightened.",
            "Bond 1": "A lump of narcissism that prioritizes \u201cpleasure\u201d.And a calamity to men and animals that exploits\u30fbpreys upon the lives of others and leads them to ruin in the process.At first, those who get to know her are touched by her holy mother-like kindness and join her faith as if fascinated.Afterwards, due to an unreasonable need to be loved by her, they earnestly do nothing but pursue their own desires, exposing their foolishness. However, desire is something that ends up growing dull the more you fulfill it.And this woman does not like dulled pleasures.At some point, any one of her believers will no longer be of any interest to this woman, and take his own life out of the despair of \u201cshe no longer loves me\u201d. Therefore, her victims have both their bodies and assets devoured whole.Just like a vengeful ghost, this woman insists on perceiving that all her actions are good.Not lying to herself at all, and yet she preys upon the surroundings with words laced with lies, consuming them for her own sake.The absoluteness of that ego - her lack of hesitation - would seem like an enlightened mental state for an ordinary person. If there is anything \u201csaint\u201d-like about her, it would be this point alone.",
            "Bond 2": "Banshoku Yuutai: EXThe heterodoxy Kiara once employed in a certain virtual world.It was a medical software that separated others into \u201cbody, mind and soul\u201d, laying their souls bare (that is, in a condition that is not being protected by the body and the mind) in order to hear their troubles and remove their pains.Of course, that was only a front.Kiara would take these defenseless souls that have been separated from the body and mind and absorb them into her own soul, savoring them while talking about redemption.The ultimate \u201cfascination\u201d, and also the power to \u201dturn others into believers\u201d.Having turned into a Beast, that power became even greater.Having received a Mara (crown of the beast) on her head and turned into a heavenly demon (bewitching bodhisattva), Kiara\u2019s beauty jolts the sanity\u30fbintellect\u30fbethics of those who look at her.Those who Kiara stared at, or maybe those who saw Kiara must, at that moment, make a check to see if they can maintain \u201cthemselves\u201d.Not a \u201cSanity Check\u201d, but a \u201cKiara Check\u201d.Sight, taste, hearing, smell, and touch. A save is performed for each and every single one of them, and you\u2019ll be out if you feel that Kiara is \u201cbeautiful\u201d even a little.You will then lose sight of yourself and, after being struck by a small dizziness, will then lose your proper sense of reality and balance.You\u2019ll then end up becoming Kiara\u2019s follower - already standing on the bodhisattva\u2019s palm without even realizing.",
            "Bond 3": "Banshoku Yuutai: EXUpon opening my eyes, an infinite skin-colored plain was there.On top of the bewitching bodhisattva\u2019s palm.Beyond the endlessly distant horizon, Kiara smiled.\u201cMankind are all immature animals.Eating desires, indulging in desires,transient substances melting in desires---\u201dIf there is a goddess that can accept such animal nature like a bodhisattva, who would be able to refuse this great, immeasurable love - and how?Both enlightenment and nirvana turn into Deliberate Overwhelming Joy with a single move of her fingers.The final destination is Sesshouin, a heavenly paradise that is like a jaw....just like that, anyone becomes powerless before this heavenly demon - no matter how much power they have. It is difficult for those with intellect, those who know joy, those who know pain to escape this redemption.Of course, even if you call it redemption, this is by no means salvation. It might sound good to call it receiving the bodhisattva\u2019s mercy and all, but that is merely the opinions of the victims.Because for Kiara, the followers on top of her palm are nothing but \u201cmobs\u201d who fell down into insect-like existences.",

If this special trait falls to C Rank, it becomes a mere hindrance. Really, it would be equivalent to foreplay.Nega Saver: AThe fate of a beast who, despite possessing the qualifications of a messiah (Saver), wanted to save only her own world.It negates all the skills possessed by the Saver and Ruler Classes, increases the fascination chances towards targets with A Rank or below in MGI to 300%, and raises up the buff effects applied by Kiara to 200%.",
            "Bond 5": "Karma Phage: EXKiara\u2019s five senses... erogenous zones... cut up and distributed to others as skills when she turned her body into a SE.RA.PH.Appears to be an imitation of the method how BB discarded her love towards humans - having regarded it as redundant - to create the Alteregos.Abbreviated as KP, they were each designated as Body, Sight, Mouth, Spice and Organ. Because the Sentinels bestowed with these are granted Kiara\u2019s Authority, they become extremely powerful Servants. Heaven\u2019s HoleA branch of Magic called Third Magic.Although it pulls on matter with supergravity - just like a black hole - supposedly, its true nature is that of a disposal hole.\u201cSomething inconvenient for humans to have when attempting to do good\u201d. The \u201cHeaven\u2019s Hole\u201d receives these selfish humans\u2019 malignant data - \u201call the world\u2019s desires\u201d - and continues to grow.Evidently an abhorrent deposit, but this hole is a mechanism that society cannot do without, and its scale will keep expanding so long intellectual activities are carried out.Even while amassing disgusting ambitions that humans cannot allow.",
            "Extra": " Love is a good thing. And desire is also a good thing.But one must never turn \u201clove into a pleasure\u201d.Originally, love and desire are things that ought to be regarded as separate from each other.However, when the soul of a messiah that loved and wished to please humans reached the Third Magic, Sesshouin Kiara metamorphosed into something not-human.Saving all animals on Earth by means of pleasure, and also seeking the greatest salvation by becoming a receptacle for that pleasure.She who attempted to reach the climax by exploiting 7 billion lives just for her own (one\u2019s) sake.She who attempted to save \u201chumans\u201d with nothing but pleasure, without any goal beyond that nor knowing of satisfaction.Her Class was determined by this true nature described above.Pleasure Deva and the likes are nothing but fake names.This is a great disaster that saves mankind in the most straightforward (shortest) manner, achieved by a single individual.Its name is Beast III/R.One of the seven human vices, the beast carrying the principle of \u201clust\u201d."

Bunyan is nothing more than a shallow fake, a folklore hero in name only. This is thought to be the reason why Bunyan as a servant does not fully possess her legendary powers.",

            "Extra": " Will she ever learn her lesson?Summer festival, Ishtar CupThat was a great ceremony for the sake of resurrecting Ishtar\u2019s familiar, the Bull of Heaven Gugalanna.After having her reputation completely ruined by losing Gugalanna on the day when a calamity struck the Mesopotamian world, Ishtar probably has been vigilantly waiting for a favorable chance to get revenge.And the result is what we see at this time.I will say it again. Will she ever learn her lesson?The Goddess Ishtar converted the precious ritual tools she secretly borrowed from the treasury of Babylon into a Holy Grail, pasted the texture of Venus over the land of Connacht with its power, and then planned to create Gugalanna once more by having powerful Heroic Spirits offer their gratitude (race) over the earth.Remodeling the Ishtar Temple into a giant prana resources accumulation circuit(1) was also a part of this. The Ishtar QPS (Quantum-piece Power System) is a devilish money collection installation that sucks prone not only from people, but also Heroic Spirits, making it her own. The more QP is collected, more Ishtar\u2019s divine rank goes up. That deed is truly that of an evil deity among evil deities.",

Not only he instructed many daimyou and their younger relatives in the Shinkage-ryuu, but also sent his disciples to serve influential daimyou as swordsmanship intructors.In historical novels and historical plays, he is often regarded as an extraordinary plotter.This is probably out of the notion that, in the early Edo period, it would be impossible to raise the Yagyuu clan up to a social position of a Daimy\u014d with 12,500 koku just by being honest and upright.",

Shigemasa - a daimyou of 15,000 koku - was lacking in strength despite leading all the western daimyou and found himself forced into a hard fight as a result. As he saw the situation turning grimmer, Shogun Iemitsu dispatched his chief vassal, Matsudaira Nobutsuna, to act as supreme commander, but Shigemasa became impatient upon learning that, and attempted an assault on the enemy camp before Nobutsuna arrived, dying tragically in the process.",

First, she is one who thrives on prosperous business. There is no tolerance for greedy, pointless expenditure.

She freely wields a spear-like cage; at times stabbing the enemy with, at times imprisoning souls, at times summoning lightning, she is the fearsome ruler of the netherworld.Having carried out her duties of administrating the netherworld since birth, she is a goddess that disappeared along with the Age of Gods without ever knowing of the world above, or of freedom.This form is not that of the Goddess Ereshkigal, but that of a Pseudo-Servant where she has possessed the soul of a human with a similar wavelength to hers.Though she claims that her role is merely to supervise humans, like the netherworld goddess that she is... \"...it's a problem if so many people are coming to the netherworld... it's also a big issue creating cages to confine all these souls... I wonder if I can provide them a more comfortable place to be in...\"In this way, it's hard to fully conceal her caring heart. She is truly a red angel of the netherworld.",

While she was revived afterward, the reason Ishtar went down to the underworld, and the reason Ereshkigal was so enraged are never spoken of, and in this work, they are treated as stemming from them being one and the same.

Ebih through earthquakes and alterations to the very terrain. While its firepower falls short of Ishtar's venus buster, the true meaning of this noble phantasm lies in 'changing the field to the underworld'. Within the underworld where she boasts the highest authority, Ereshkigal and all those who fight alongside her are granted a powerful grace.",
            "Bond 4": "Magic Resistance DNullify any magecraft less than D in rank.Drenched in the gloom of the underworld, death has become an everyday occurrence, considerably lowering her resistance to magic.The Secret Great Crown A The crown of a goddess said to have been created from what she took from Ishtar.Of the heaven and earth, it allows her to make the various graces bestowed unto Ishtar her own, but those effects are made slightly darker (more gloomy).Mana Burst (Cage) A+ Ereshkigal is a diligent, earnest, and somewhat pessimistic goddess. On a regular basis, as long as she has the free time, she'll store up her mana in her spear cages to release in battle. Blessing of Kur EX Offered as a pillar of the underworld she came to rule, Ereshkigal's authority.Until her rule comes to an end, she who controls the underworld is the underworld itself, as well as the queen protected by its bounds.Provides support to all allies as well as changing the effect of her Noble Phantasm.",
            "Bond 5": "A passive and introverted nature. Because of the high wisdom and pride she boasts, she sacrifices herself to the duties of mistress of the underworld, bound by her own design to be goddess of death and decline.Envying the beautiful, laughing at the unsightly, and killing so that which she desired never passes to the hand of another. ... or so was Ereshkigal, but due to her assimilation with the young girl she inhabits, she has gained an objective awareness that such things are 'not good' and 'embarrassing', her brutality disappearing to the depths. But as she is a frank person, once angered, that side will come to the surface, becoming the unfortunate goddess as terrifying as told in legend. The principles she acts on belong to the goddess Ereshkigal, occasionally making her seem more level-headed and self-depreciating than the young girl serving as her vessel. She has the same theatrical elocution as Ishtar but occasionally breaks into the tone of an elegant lady. Like suddenly becoming honest, or emphasizing a 'My, oh my,' when panicking, those courteous gestures are her 'base portion' coming out. While Ishtar was originally raised as a sheltered girl, the pampering and unbridled freedom afforded to her caused her to develop the speech of a woman of action. Meanwhile, as Ereshkigal diligently carried out her duties in the underworld, it is surmised her choice of words became that of a 'sheltered (oblivious) young lady'.",
            "Extra": " Ereshkigal detests how she was hated and suffered as a social outcast from the age of the gods. \"I want to try living as freely as Ishtar. I want to meet someone who accepts that I'm mistress of the underworld, but doesn't let that status affect how they see me.\" she even held such a romantic notion.\"I won't deny the fact I'm a villain, but evil, as it is, has its uses for humanity. Why does everyone have to be so afraid of me!?\" As she sulked so in her heart, she found the end of the Mesopotamian world before her eyes, participating in the three-goddess alliance and making an enemy of Uruk to save humans in her own way. After a series of events, she sunk into the abyss, yet after yet another series of events, affirmed her 'current self' choosing to cooperate with Chaldea in order to repair human civilization. The spear in her hand is the blazing soul of Meslamtaea. A grace only granted in this materialized form, the light that warms the depths of the earth.",

However, they are all in the shapes of adorable sheep (space version). Why is it like this?",

            "Bond 3": "The personality is basically Altera's, but as a result of having a fever, her decision-making ability is lower than usual, so it's easier to give her detailed instructions. It even feels like she got sweeter and more charming.Due to the fever (thankfully), her civilization destroying meter has lowered considerably.The usual Altera's personality is 90% that of a warrior and 10% of a girl,while Altera Santa's 40% warrior and 60% girl.Altera's core is that of a romanticist maiden, so being entrusted with the role of Santa Claus makes her happy and excited.Since the Master is a reliable partner, they are seen as a lovely sheep and she refers to them as \"fluffy Master\".Since \"I am Santa Claus before I am Altera now\" is what she tells herself, her demeanor and responses are softer.In order to deliver \"precious gifts\" that were entrusted to her by the shining sheep, she relies on her straightforward Master.",
            "Bond 4": "Magic Resistance: CSince she is unable to refuse when receiving a complaint of \"It's different from the present I wanted\" due to her gentle nature, her magical resistance has been lowered compared to her time as a Saber.Riding: EXChosen as the Heroic Spirit of Christmas, burning with a quiet determination, Altera greatly improved and altered her Riding skill.Specifically, she became a sheep master.Seeing the figure that can't help spurring on the sheep called Zerco as if it was a fine horse, one is reminded of the strongest King of the nomadic tribe that galloped through the Western World, the Huns...one is reminded of that...right?Civilization Erosion: EXA skill that's used by Altera unconsciously. Anything in Altera's grasp is transformed into its 'best' form currently most suited for herself. 'Best' does not necessarily mean 'most excellent', since it is based on Altera's own perspective (her current obsession).It goes without saying what Altera is obsessed with right now.The subordinates she was expected to take along were originally horses, but turned into sheep (-like creatures) and her beloved sword, the Sword of the God of War, transformed into the Cane of the God of War.",

But as a baby carrying the blood of the god, she was brought up by countless doves and given a new lease on life. Growing up beautifully, Semiramis was wed to the aging general  Onnes, but the ambitious King Ninus captivated by her face half-forcefully parted her from her husband. Led to sorrow, Onnes committed suicide, and Semiramis was left with no choice but for her body to accept the King's grace.When the novel tactics Semiramis suggested in a war with foreign lands landed them a victory, King Ninus came to know of her splendid talent, finally deciding a formal marriage with  her.But the moment  King Ninus put his lips to his wine glass at the wedding banquet, he suddenly collapsed in pain and died.  It is rumored that she laced it with poison to take revenge for her late husband.  And thus having become Empress of Assyria, Semiramis  took over the duties of managing governmental affairs for  many decades,  spearheading numerous expeditions and construction projects.Afterwards, it's been said she was murdered by her son, or perhaps after handing off power she became a dove and flew away.",

As truth would have it,  Semiramis did not have any involvement with the actual Hanging Gardens. But through the faith of the countless people who misunderstood, it has materialized as a noble phantasm.Owing to the Vanity in its name, the conditions to activate this noble phantasm are harsh. Dirt and stone from near east ruins dating beyond a certain point must be transported and combined, and only then will it be fully ready to activate.After that, a three-day ceremony is required for it to finally gain functionality as a garden.It has manifested as a 'Grand Fortress Hanging in the Air' just as the name might imply. As long as she is within its bounds, Semiramis receives a boost to all her parameters.Her degree of fame is elevated to its highest possible value, and it even includes some beneficial renovations for offense.In a certain holy grail war, this garden became a battlefield. Its eleven defensive spells shot down incoming planes one after the next, but the Holy  Maiden's flag, and the charge of a flying cavalier finally tore through its defenses.",

Whether they be friend or foe, she will kick them down, kill them with a sip of poison, have a poison break their heart.She holds a strong distrust of others, and even if one might call themself her ally, whether they be necessary to her or not, they will be dealt with. This is simultaneousy due to the fact she boasts absolute confidence in her own power (though this is restricted to her own domain).  Therefore her affinity with other kings is depressingly bad, and it is quite rare for her to go out and fight on her own.The exception to this is when her 'Hanging Gardens' are in their completed state.

Fujino, who had a high intelligence since she was young, for the sake of protecting herself, concealed the fact that she had analgia in order to appear to her surroundings as \"an ordinary human\" and even deceived her own self.

Because of this, she seems to harbor an admiration that is more than affection (feelings of love) towards a perfectly rational person.She is a talented woman who holds common sense in high regard, but since she is a complete pessimist and realist at her foundation, sometimes, she makes bitter comments too. Very patient, but once she loses her self-control, she's like a runaway dump truck that won't stop until the opponent is cornered (until the situation is resolved). In this way, she is similar to Shiki who makes decisions mercilessly.Her mannerism, tone of voice and character are all feminine, but her hobbies are quite different from a young girl's. An appreciation for horror films, she likes to enjoy dark things by herself in secret. The person herself won't notice it even in her final moments, but she has a latent sadistic disposition.

Regarding her current self, she is nothing more than a \u300edream\u300f. Similar to Shiki, observed just before being reduced to cinders, she's just an illusion of a single night that will disappear if the Incineration of the Human Order is overturned. While the normal thing to do would've been to fall into panic and confusion, Fujino accepted this abnormality without trouble. Summoned as a Servant, she understands her position precisely and it seems like she will do her best to be the Master's power to the extent that she is capable of.",

            "Bond 5": "Strictly speaking, the existence of the so-called \u201cViy\u201d, as either a spirit or a monster, does not exist.It was the Russian Author Gogol who introduced Viy as a made-up monster in his short horror novella, \u201cViy\u201d.However, Slavic folklore resembling Viy does exist, and it has been proposed that these legends served as inspiration for the tale itself.Viy, whom Anastasia made a contract with, was a familiar kept around by the Romanov Empire. He used his demonic eyes to open all sorts of secrets, to spot weak spots in strongholds, and furthermore, to bathe those who oppose them in blood.However, without the right talent, you will not be able to see nor control him. Anastasia eventually met the requirements to make a contract with him just moments before her death.",
            "Extra": " Originally, she is an existence who possesses no significant power even as a Servant, but due to the interference of the Lostbelt, she acquired Viy\u2019s power and it appears that she has earned unparalleled strength.She is anguishing on the threshold between her sense of duty of guiding the citizens as the descendant of the Romanov Empire and her hatred for having been massacred along with her family by those same citizens.What she\u2019ll choose depends on the Master, but most of the time, while harboring hatred, she would pick the path full of hardships to carry out her duty.She is not so weak that she'd keep hating faceless somebodies."

            "Bond 5": "As a Servant Caster, he is likely a type that is difficult to handle.It should be possible to understand that this is also due a side of his that mercilessly tramples anyone underfoot so long it is for the sake of realising his dream.Having a poor health, he often suffered from some sort of illness - among which a skin disease was particularly serious. Maybe because of that, it has been said that he was gloomy and pessimistic. In this work, one can peek in his heart by the manner how he never takes off his mask to show his face.In actual history, Avicebron became known across Arabia and Europe thanks to his philosophical thoughts. In a sense, it could be also said that he supported the Renaissance culture.Also, he invented the term \"Kabbalah\" from the Hebraic word for \"to receive\".In legends, it has also been said that he minted a female-type golem for the sake of performing daily housework."

Namely, into lawful and chaotic.\u25cbInnocent Monster (Lost): ADespite being a human, he proclaimed himself to be an existence equal to \u300cGod\u300dand after chasing away the aristocracy that once boasted of great influence, he became the one with the most authority.Revered as the absolute emperor in Russia, the people of Western Europe gave him the moniker \"Terrible\" in fear.In the Empire of Frozen Soil, by combining with the Demonic Beasts that boasted the title of strongest, he became a monster worthy of ruling the russian Lostbelt\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500that is how he ended up.\u25cbAlmighty Supreme Authority: AThe emperor's authority of absolute obedience the Lightning Emperor Ivan was seeking in order to rule over the opposing nobles.To the surrounding people, the strong intimidating air results in an intense \"heavy pressure\" that lowers the rank of their full capacity.

This is not entirely unrelated to the fact that his mother's name - Philyra - means linden tree. For the flower of the linden tree can be used as a medicine if handled with care, and its bark was employed in divination and as a writing board.Upon becoming an adult, Chiron began to receive requests from all over Greece to rear \"future heroes\". Other than the great heroes Heracles and Achilles, his students included the future God of Medicine Asclepius and Castor - who would later be sublimated into the Gemini constellation. Even Jason, the leader of the Argonautai, was among those who received his teachings.That being said, according to Iason \"Well, for someone like me, those sorts of concise and easy-to-understand lessons were quite jarring instead!

Strengthened by the magical energy of the divine spirits Freyja and Louhi, it changed appearance from a hound to a bear; and its existence has become close to that of an Elemental. If it's a goddess' familiar, a fierce and large appearance is rather fitting, but it won't do for it to be a phantasm or mythical beast--- as a result of Freyja accepting that claim from Louhi, two out of three agreed to turn it into a bear. A permanently active Noble Phantasm. When its True Name is invoked, consecutive attacks consisting of [a charge attack by the dog (bear)], [a bow-and-arrow attack filled with ice magic], and [a slash from Sitonai] will occur like an avalanche. Due to Sitonai's nature, it will apply a special effect against dragons."

            "Bond 3": "The Xiang Yu who was handed down to others as a hegemon who was a rare genius and a fool at the same time. After all, his true character wasn't something that others could comprehend.He is an artificial human designed based on the wreckage of Prince Nezha that Shi Huang Di recovered while he was searching for the immortal realms/realm of the sages, and was stolen by Xiang Liang who, giving him the name Xiang Ji, then pretended to be his uncle.After Xiang Liang's death, there was a sense of purpose that's been programmed into him in the beginning\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015namely, the intelligence of a machine that kept driving him for the sake of the early realization of a \"peaceful world\". However, that methodology was a complete deviation from morality.He destroyed and slaughtered with the intention of \"simplifying and limiting\" the strategical scope of China so the next ruler could quickly rise to power. From the people\u2019s point of view, however, these were just like the futile deeds of a tyrannical Demon King.However, as a result, the Chu\u2013Han Contention - the chaotic period after the collapse of the Qin dynasty - ended in just 4 years, and Liu Bang went from being a chivalrous person from the countryside to becoming the founder of the Han dynasty.",

Usually, he remains calm like a large tree, but the moment he perceives an omen of disorder with his future vision, like a storm, Xiang Yu will wildly eliminate his target.Since this would be impossible to understand for a regular person who can not perceive the future, as a Servant, Xiang Yu is classified as a Berserker.",

Thanks to this, even before the Western Renaissance, China has accomplished an Industrial Revolution. Due to the overwhelming gap in technology, he managed to conquer the entire world.",

That massive frame has reached a stage where it can float in the skies of Xianyang[4] by utilizing anti-gravity.The majestic form of the Emperor's gargantuan frame that the dominion's masses have an audience with no regard for day or night, is surely an appropriate embodiment of observation and regulation. With the calculation ability that equals that of a god, the Emperor is the one who decides the life expectancy of his subjects.",
            "Bond 4": "The inner structure of the mechanized emperor form is not that of a human body, but an imitation of the natural environment itself, assuming the aspect of an artificial garden that is a miniature mountain forest with rivers of mercury flowing through it. The body itself of the Epang Palace-type Qin Shi Huang is a microcosmos, and it operates based on the principles of fengshui sorcery which is in accordance with how nature truly moves.Afterwards, he got the chance to analyze the sample of a living female immortal, but despite making it possible to maintain a humanoid vessel with the technique of a Shijie xian,[5] Qin Shi Huang already had the form of a super dreadnought-class arithmetic unit that was fitting for the administrator who ruled the world.The only reason a man like that took on the humanoid form that he cultivated once again, was to settle the single decisive battle that he agreed to.",

She who didn't have any relatives was for some reason picked up by Luvia and obtained the surname of Edelfelt, and does a living as a maid. Her knowledge of Physics and Mathematics is at university level, but her communication skills are below those of a kindergartener on the other hand. The first friend someone like her made is Illya. Whether it is because she can't distinguish between friendship and affection or for any other reason, Illya returns a feeling of deep affection to Miyu, whose sense of distance suddenly became zero, while being confused about her. While repeating their ordinary and extraordinary lives, someday the two became inseparable friends. By the way, Chloe seems to be a rival-like existence scrambling for Illya.",

Not the only exception among the successive Sakatsuki, she abandoned her greed, and purely continued wishing only for happiness as a child. As people, this method continued being taken for granted to act as a parent for 500 years, but she was a miracle surpassing the Child of God. But\u2015\u2015\u2015.

            "Bond 2": "Her origin is that she is one of the Horae's three sisters from Greek Mythology.Although she was supposed to be Zeus' and Themis' daughter, there are few accounts of it in legends.The legends go that she remained on Earth, since the Iron Age where corruption is rampant, until the very end where the Gods were leaving one by one, and brought justice to the people. After that, her scales became the constellation Libra, and she herself became the constellation Virgo, which very few tales tell of a different story.However, later on, she and her mother Themis, who was equated to her, were given a different name and connotation that is Justitia of Roman Mythology. Namely, Lady Justice. The Goddess of Justice.If you see a female statue holding a sword and a scale in front of courthouses or law firms, that would be them.",

That is to say, the pro wrestler will not die.\u25cbMana Burst (Star): AWith the power of the stars, not only humans on Earth, but even Divine Spirits would have to accept her verdict if they become the targets of her judgement.",

If it was an immature Master, it would inspire her to lead even more. At the same time, due to the nature of the possessed girl, she is even much stricter to Master's conduct. If she feels the Master's conduct is indecent, she would not hesitate to show her guidance (with extreme physical methods, including drop kicks). If you were to walk along side her, then you better not be slacking off on your training."

The various weapons that Add is able to transform into is made possible from the overflowing power of Rhongomyniad.Though it may be sealed by the mystic code and placed under 13 restrictions, the Holy Spear continues to shine as bright as ever.",

The enraged Ge\u00dfler arrested Tell, but Tell managed to escape midway.And \u2014\u2014\u2014 in order to escape from the governor\u2019s revenge, in order to protect his sons from the governor\u2019s rage, Tell did what he needed to do. He sniped Ge\u00dfler on horse at a narrow valley\u2019s road, piercing his heart.Peace returned to the city that lost its tyrant, Tell was honored as a hero, and beginning from here, the momentum of the Swiss independent movementbecame stronger and stronger \u2014\u2014\u2014",

Nonetheless, having been born with excessive strength as a person herself, Kagetora during her lifetime has never managed to comprehend the exceedingly frail entities known as humans.Without understanding human emotions like sadness or anger in the slightest, Kagetora wears a smile as her only compromise with her surroundings.  As the recipients of her unapproachable behavior and words, Kagetora's retainers fear her, yet that fear morphed and took form as fanatical faith.  And as a result, an even more inhuman way of life, reminiscent of gods and buddhas, has been forced upon Kagetora.To that Kagetora, the brief scenes of life and death interspersed among the lethal conflicts she took part in, were the only times she felt human at all.After having lived her life so detached from the mundane, she attained her divine seat as the God of War, and was venerated accordingly.

Mashu and other such homunculi share this truth.)Having lived through the eons, this planet will soon face its end.To you children who have only been given mere tens of thousands of years to advance:Please, show this dying planet one last dream -at the end of your small, brilliant childhoods.",

Even if only a dream of the dead, he was someone who lived in the present (now).Small Da Vinci is much the same. She spends her days and nights busy in order to achieve all that she can. However, as she is running on a weaker engine now, she bears some dissatisfaction and uncertainty towards herself.\"Am I doing as well as the previous me?\"Her saying this is an expression of that uncertainty.Although she inherited all the memories of the previous Da Vinci, small Da Vinci never experienced any of those memories herself.Because of that, she envies \"the years that my original self spent together with the staff of Chaldea\".This also leads to a anxious desire to make memories to match up, and a sense of responsibility that \"I have to leave results that I can be proud of, even when compared to the original\".",

In turn, Paris chose Aphrodite.But, Helen was already a wife of Menelaus, so, inevitably, Paris made away with Helen.So the men who once fought to be Helen's husband, after Helen was taken, chose to collaborate to get her back, swearing a pledge to do so.The earliest battle was inevitable,and Troy fell into war with the Greek Allies.It was the beginning of the Trojan War, which it was referred to as later.",

But situations of fortuity/luck/contempt sided with her, and she eventually fulfilled the assassination.It was later investigated whether there were collaborators in her assassination planning, but it was concluded that there was almost no doubt that Charlotte Corday planned the assassination alone.She was executed with the guillotine, and the man in charge at the moment was Charles-Henri SansonIn the way from the prison to the execution stage, Sanson traveled with her for about two hours, and admired her in his memoirs with \"She kept a gentle and brave attitude to the end, and didn't expose fear or anger\".",

Due to Leviathan's influence, she is deeply envious. However, from the beginning she has always been obsessed with the idea of \"the only thing I love\".

Together, the two were one. However, while Behemoth was a gentle-natured herbivore, Leviathan was a vicious beast. All leviathans are recorded as being female, and later on, they are depicted as enormous snakes.For humans, the ocean was an existence alongside death up until the Middle Ages. From this, Leviathan became to be thought of as a devil-like monster, and all of a sudden, Leviathan came to be the symbol for the seventh Deadly Sin: Envy.In satanism, Leviathan is subordinate to Beelzebub and holds power and authority in Hell. Besides that, Leviathan is also the grand admiral of the navies of Hell. On the other hand, in the Book of Job, Leviathan is just a large creature that swims around in the ocean, making whirlpools and bringing forth waves. \"As long as we have Divinity and we're girls, that makes us goddesses right??? \u2606\"BB-chan's simple interpretation explodes forth.",

Poor Okita-san died... (Actually she's not dead).Oh shoot!? Not only I made contact with the native population, but also killed her... It's going to affect my bonus' assessment!! was what XX-san was convinced thus got panicked, she used the leftover parts she had on-hand to sloppily put together a life-support system (Jetpack), and as a result of it being equipped on her, a mysterious Shinsengumi woman was born. Actually she just lost consciousness, and with XX-san's mistake, she became a futuristic Shinsengumi Soldier who is incorporated with the Universe's mysterious technologies.Thanks to the life-support system, the limit on her Weak Constitution skill was also removed, in addition, she also obtained a theoretically over 800 years of operation and an overly healthy body, however due to some misunderstandings, Okita-san thought she only had 3 days left to live.This form that can freely soar through the blue sky, to the girl who was engulfed in the warm light under the edge of the eaves and fleetingly faded away in the waves of time, perhaps can be said to be an irreplaceable long summer dream.Of course, since the disturbance to space-time caused by XX-san only has enough magical energy for the summer, so once summer ends, everything would turn back to how it once was.

She is in a mysterious position, where despite her villainous intentions, her actions end up benefitting people.Due to her awareness as a \u201cThreat to Humanity\u201d, her alignment is evil. However, this does not mean she is a villain or bad.Although she has roughly the same personality as the Ishtar from the Greater History of Man, she won\u2019t toy with others in a playful mood. She proudly recognises that the good deeds of individuals that are \u201cright\u201d, secret rejoicing them, and scowls with hostility at the bad deeds of individuals that are \u201ccruel\u201d, boldly insulting them.(And if the person is a villain, she mercilessly squeezes their assets, life and fate out of them.)S Ishtar is the same as Ishtar, with a free-spirited personality, looking down on the cruelty and shallowness of human society. However, while that may be so, she takes into account the lives of people, cares for good people accordingly and in the end, she puts everyone\u2019s victory over her personal gain is the unbecoming direction Ishtar has taken. For example, like the time of the summer race, should she try to revive Gugalanna at the expense of others in order for the restoration of Ishtar, S Ishtar would reconsider in the end, destroy Gugalanna by her own hand and split the resources amongst the participants. \u201cOf course, its so wasteful that I want to riot, but I felt like that\u2019s what had to be done! I can\u2019t lie to myself, you know?\u201dLike this, while she fundamentally is Ishtar, in the end she will never change her position and become an enemy of humanity.

Because normal Ishtar is so friendly, S Ishtar feels more like \u201cthe big sister from next door\u201d. Though since she keeps her distance like a stranger, her big sister from next door feeling decreases. Instead, the feeling of her as \u201csomeone who is just out of your league but shining nearby\u201d is strong. \u25cbIndependent Action: CBorn as a goddess, raised as a human and awakened as a servant, even without a contract with a master, S Ishtar does not consume magical power by materialising in this world.\u25cbGoddess' Essence: A++Because Ishtar inherited the core of the \u201cAncient Goddess of Fertility and War\u201d, the prototype of many goddesses similar to Ishtar\u2026\u2026 Ishtar, Astarte, Anat\u2026\u2026its rank is almost at its highest.",

However, later in Western Europe, this name born from the old testament  degraded to a devil (Astaroth).\u25cbDevil's Sugar: AWhile worrying about the fact that she has degraded into a devil, she makes full use of the power of \u201ctemptation and excitement\u201d, exactly like a true devil. S Ishtar\u2019s smiles and kiss throwing improves the morale of allies, and allows them to draw out power to go beyond their limit, ignoring physical burdens. With this charm (curse), allies will already be charmed by her so enemies\u2019 charm has no effect.With her side as a goddess of victory and her complex side as a demon who destroys people, it can be called the devil\u2019s charisma. \u25cbVenus Driver: BSomething that moves Venus.

The primordial universe refers to something older than the Sapphire Galaxy (Ether Universe, now the Universe World), a universe where humans were humans,Even older within the ancient universe \u2014 before the birth of mammals on Earth, Astarte was a goddess worshipped  by a prehistoric ancient civilization in this universe.At this time, when humans had no concept of faith, goddess was a word that referred to \u201ca sector of space where life can exist\u201d.While whether the concept took shape, or that way things should have been became a concept is uncertain, Ishtar Astarte of the primordial universe became \u201ca galaxy in the shape of a human\u201d. Originally, it shouldn\u2019t be something that humans can handle or something that can become a servant. Professor Tokiomi, who accidentally discovered the goddess\u2019s spirit core, raised her as \u201cthe good half\u201d. After his death, he left his daughter\u2019s fate in the hands of a trust-worthy assistant.\u201cEven if I teach her the textbook definition of good, (as S Ishtar is a smart child) she immediately identified its hypocrisy, unless I\u2019m by her side, one day, in good faith, she may turn back to evil. However, if Jane, someone who was good at heart, not two-faced and could get to the truth in a linear path at the cost of causing destruction and confusion around her, could show her that good and bad are not opposite sides of the same coin, she will at least not descend into pure evil.\u201dAs the professor predicted, S Ishtar grew up into a healthy(?) and fierce bounty hunter who did not become evil, trained as an excellent Tsukkomi, and although easy to anger and noisy about money, she helps the weak and bites onto the strong.On the other hand, Jane, shockingly, didn\u2019t change at all.",

Unable to bear seeing Astolfo looking so dejected, Nightingale turned them back into Saber, thus officially Astolfo Saber was born.By the way, the first thing ever that Astolfo wanted to do upon turning back to a Saber was turning to Master and shouting\"I'm your sword!\"They had always wanted to say this line boldly as Saber-class.The reason they yearned to become a Saber is, well, something of this feeling.",

Following her death and deification, she came to be in the form of a girl riding on the back of a pure-white bull, Taurus of the Zodiac.

She\u2019s a party girl servant.Sei Sh\u014dnagon was a girl that was ahead of the times and lit up her surroundings while musing about her love for the beauty of things around her.Though there is the question of where exactly her poet-like appearance has gone to, in her case due to having such a strong connection with the culture of today\u2019s young people she ended up being summoned in her current appearance.As there is the historical fact that when she was within Teishi\u2019s inner circle she was concerned about her age, her current appearance as a high school girl isn't that unexpected.She gets along with the Murasaki Shikibu in Chaldea.

Looking back on a fulfilling life where even love and hate was left behind, she lives on holding just a single star tight to her chest. At the same time though, another star vanished. She lacked what it took to become a guardian of humanity.However, due to a certain incident where an irregular summoning occured, Sei Sh\u014dnagon ended up being given a chance. Through her various experiences and trusting the people whose hearts she connected with, the poet sealed away inside her and the new possibilities that were born have resulted in her current self being accepted by the Throne of Heroes.And.. in the end the summoning was a success.Even if the Master had yet to experience those wild days with Nagiko Sei Sh\u014dnagon would have surely been looking forward to the time where they would meet again.",

A love surpassing what was held between this brother and sister was never to be seen again.

Pollux also began to hold hatred against humanity due to what humanity had made her brother go through.As a result of this, the brother and sister began to possess flames of hatred in their hearts and while interacting with the citizens of Olympus and Chaldea they were ever so violent and vicious.\u25c6On the other hand, their Pan-Human History selves that were summoned to Chaldea, do not hold as much hatred as their Lostbelt counterparts.

At one point after turning down numerous courters, Caenis received the love of the sea god Poseidon (Neptune) and also lost the chastity once held. Satisfied, the sea god said, \"I will grant all of your wishes\" to which Caenis replied, \"Please make me no longer a woman so that I will never have to go through an experience like this ever again\" and Caenis became an invincible man, the legend says.It cannot be said for sure that Caenis actually became a man due to some tales left behind. After death in one story, Caenis is said to have become a bird with golden wings and disappeared into the skies, but there is also another tale that the corpse of a woman was left behind.

Normally, it is unthinkable that a Divine Spirit would be summoned as a Grand Class servant. However, due to the deep relationship Romulus holds with human history and his becoming a supreme god while living as a human, he who is an exception above exceptions has brought an innumerable amount of miracles together to be summoned as a Grand Class Lancer in the Fifth Lostbelt.Within the Fifth Lostbelt, numerous servants who sided with humanity stood up to the Lostbelt King Zeus, but all lost in battle. These servants gathered the last vestiges of their power into one final grand plan, and entrusted their hope to Chaldea. That final grand plan was called \u201cOperation: God Slayer\u201d. Simultaneously holding onto his human self and his existence as a peak god within the entirety of mythological records, he stood on the side of humanity. Capable of wielding power in the same realm as the almighty and all knowing Zeus of Greek Mythology, Romulus-Quirinus would be summoned as a part of \u201cOperation: God Slayer\u201d.Following this the team from Chaldea made their appearance and \u201cOperation: God Slayer\u201d finally took form. Romulus-Quirinus manifested and from there did battle together with Chaldea and brought down the Machine Gods of the Lostbelt. And he then disappeared along with the God Slayer.Thought to never be able to fully manifest ever again\u2026However, thanks to the relationship fostered with the master and being recorded within Novum Chaldea\u2019s Trismegistus, it became possible for his Spirit Origin to be summoned as a non-Grand Class servant. Once again he wields his spear of light for humanity."
