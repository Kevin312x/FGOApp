            "Bond 5": "Although a target of hatred by many people during the French Revolution, her reputation has been restored in modern France.\n\nDuring famines, she reduced court expenses to make donations, demanded herself for the nobility to provide support to the people and such - it has thus been confirmed she was a woman that thought of the people.\n\n",

Deploys three thousand arquebuses and uses them for volley firing.\n\nDue to its famous anecdote of defeating the strongest cavalry of the Warring States Period, attack power increases against Heroic Spirits that possess the Skill Riding.\n\nThey are nothing but normal arquebuses against Heroic Spirits that do not possess the Riding Skill, but a volley firing of three thousands is already enough of a threat in itself.\n\n",

Hiei\") and the accumulated feelings of fear and reverence held by the later masses, Heroic Spirit Nobunaga manifests as a demon lord.\n\n",
            "Extra": " Nobunaga had worked vigorously towards the unification of the country, but her end came from the insurrection of a vassal.\n\nShe shows no regret about that in itself, saying it was \"something that couldn't be helped\".\n\nDoes not particularly have a wish for the Holy Grail, but it is very likely that, due her tendency for unusual ideas, she may use the Holy Grail itself to make some sort of bomb.\n\n",

            "Bond 2": "Karna is a demigod hero born from the human girl Kunti and the Sun God Surya.\n\nHowever, right after being born, he was abandoned by Kunti and raised as the son of a charioteer.\n\nStill, his attributes as a hero are not the kind of thing that can remain hidden.\n\n",
            "Bond 3": "After casting away Karna, his mother Kunti gave birth to the five sons of the Pandu royal house.\n\nThe third among them is Arjuna, someone who would become a lifelong rival for Karna.\n\nUpon growing old, Karna became an adopted child of the Kuru House that was antagonic to the Pandu House.\n\n",
            "Bond 4": "However, there were too many curses and obstacles before Karna could fight Arjuna.\n\nReceiving a curse from a Brahmin, deceived by Indra, forced to swear to not fight anyone other than Arjuna in response to the appeal of his mother Kunti; but even still Karna accepted everything.\n\n",
            "Bond 5": "From the anecdotes of handing over his armor to Indra, Karna is entrusted to a god-slaying spear by dismantling,\n tearing up and discarding the golden armor.\n\nA spear of light that even the king of gods was not able to handle properly.\n\nThe single strike released by peeling off his whole body and being dyed in blood purges all sorts of impurities.\n\n\n--- O' sun, abide to death.\n\n",

            "Bond 2": "The youth that played the role of leader of the Shimabara Rebellion, an uprising that occurred in the early days of the Edo Period.\n\nHe, who concentrated on his studies since childhood, began to perform many miracles at the frontier for a time.\n\nHaving healed wounds and walked on water, he eventually began to be enthusiastically worshiped as the son of God by the peasants that believed in a prohibited religion.\n\n",
            "Bond 3": "Before long, former-vassals of Konishi Yukinaga that had him as leader established a rebel army against the Edo Shogunate.\n\nTogether with the peasants of Shimabara, who were suffering from the harsh environment of the times, they raised a large-scale insurrection.\n\nDespite taking the uprising lightly at first, the Edo Shogunate got serious due to its punitive forces being defeated and sent out Elder Matsudaira Nobutsuna as the supreme commander.\n\n",
            "Bond 4": "Matsudaira Nobutsuna brought on starvation tactics to the revolting army that had shut themselves in Hara Castle, and estimated the time when they were running out of food and ammunition to start his general offensive.\n\nIt has been told that 37,000 people - including Amakusa Shir\u014d Tokisada - were massacred by the shogunate forces, with the exception of a single traitor (there are various theories about this).\n\n",

            "Extra": " Although mediocre in parameters itself, he holds the record of being summoned under the Ruler Class during the Third Holy Grail War of Fuyuki.\n\nThanks to the function of Command Spell enforcement from God's Resolution and a strategy of poking at weaknesses by means of True Name Discernment, he reached up to one step away of attaining the Holy Grail, but was ultimately defeated due to the death of his Master.\n\n\nAmakusa Shir\u014d's dream began from that point on.\n\n",

            "Bond 3": "With unsanitary conditions caused by a lack of understanding of medical treatment and nursing and many antiquated regulations being rampant, she roused herself in conducting a reform of the wartime medical treatment that had turned into a hellish aspect.\n\nAlthough \"the mortality rate of the wartime clinic skyrocketed\" for a time, she continued her work and thoroughly enforced sanitary health and proper nursing, gathered materials by throwing away private funds with no regret, leading to success. She managed to curb a mortality rate that was close to 40% to a mere 5%.\n\n\nThe soldiers said. \"I saw an angel\".\n\n",
            "Bond 4": "Every newspaper of London extolled that she was indeed a true angel who had flied down on the battlefield. The people were crazy about that woman-hero that had appeared in the Queen's age. There were many applauses.\n\n--however, she did not smiled.\n\nNot an angel. Just, only saving people.\n\n\nShe continued to work, undertaking a major reform of wartime medical treatment and military health. Bringing in even Queen Victoria as an ally, she promoted her reforms.\n\nThe deed of promoting analysis of medical records for the sake of those reforms is also known as forerunner of statistics studies.\n\n",
            "Bond 5": "I Will Abstain From Whatever Is Deleterious And Mischievous\n\nRank: C\n\nType: Anti-Army\n\nRange: 0~40\n\nMaximum Targets: 100 people\n\nNightingale Pledge.\n\nNot only this has sublimated Nightingale's mentality, who ran into the battlefield and opposed death, but there is even connections to the concept of nurses as \"angels in white that save the sick and injured\", which holds true in modern days thanks to her own anecdotes.\n\nNegates all toxicity and hostility within the effective range. A forcibly produced absolute safety zone.\nIt also contains recovery effects.\n\n",
            "Extra": " If it is for the sake of saving lives, there is no problem in losing lives-- such excessively pure belief and terrific posture would probably even be evaluated as \"madness and horror\" at times.\n\nTherefore, she was given the Class Berserker.\n\nShe may be reluctant about it.. no, if it would save people, she would not mind at all.\n\n",
            "April Fool": " Nurse-Type Servant\n\nThe most well-known nurse in the world. She will use any means necessary to treat her patient, even if that treatment kills them.\n\n"

It is just that the \"impression\" many people catch is the former.\n\nShe just earnestly, tidily enjoys lewdness, and purely performs deviousness. She loves good men. She really loves strong men!\n\nNot going against her own desires at all, she made many men her own while alive.\n\nThe owner of the magic sword Caladbolg, Fergus, was one of her lovers.\n\nShe also really loves treasures, and for that reason she triggered a great war with the entirely of Ulster as her opponent and commanded the Connacht troops while driving her own chariot.\n\n",

Won't forgive, won't forgive, won't forgive, won't forgive, won't forgive! Absolutely, not him!\"\n\n\"C\u00fa Chulainn of Ulster! By the name Medb, the lover and ruler of all men, I swear!

            "Bond 5": "Even in modern Ireland, there are many witness reports that say \"I saw her\".\n\nOf course, those are by no means jokes.\n\nEven now, Queen Medb lives on the hearts of people as the eternal lady.\n\n",

His real name is William Henry McCarty Junior.\n\nA representative outlaw from the American Wild West, even in modern times his popularity is extremely high.\n\nFrom the fact that one of his few remaining pictures was put for a price of two hundred million yen in an auction, one can perceive said popularity.\n\nHis father is unknown, but it seems that he received a higher education from his mother and, considering he was a Western outlaw, he left behind some skillfully written letters.\n\n",

            "Bond 2": "When he was 12-years old, the curtain raised for his life as an outlaw when he stabbed to death a man who insulted his mother.\n\nSince then, he accumulated crimes of cattle theft and robbery, at the same time he took jobs of the escort of goods and the likes.\n\nHe was the type who would pick quarrels at random with the other outlaws whenever he was in town, but, before anyone knew, he started to have a smile plastered on his face and tried to avoid trouble.\n\n",
            "Bond 3": "Although he was accepted by the citizens thanks to his tactful attitude, but maybe due to his fate as an outlaw, he ended up being dragged into the cartel-war of John Tunstall, the farm owner who employed him.\n\nAs a result of this conflict, which is commonly called the Lincoln County War, Kid ended up being arrested by his one-time friend - Sheriff Pat Garrett.\n\n",
            "Bond 4": "Still, he escaped in less than a year. Sheriff Pat Garrett vindictively attempted a pursuit, finding him in Fort Sumner, New Mexico.\n\nMaybe he thought that he couldn't win even in an open gunfight, or maybe there was some other reason--.\n\nWhen Billy left his room to seek some food, Pat Garrett performed a sneak attack on him.\n\n",

The anecdotes associated with him turned into a Noble Phantasm.\n\nTo be exact, it is not like the revolver is a Noble Phantasm, and if you comprehensively look at the whole of \"Billy the Kid's marksmanship when he holds this revolver\", it seems more of a Personal Skill than a Noble Phantasm.\n\nThe most devious aspect of this Noble Phantasm is its low prana consumption, derived from the fact that the concept of Noble Phantasm is incorporated into the greater section called \"technique\".\n\nIn specific terms, it is no more than the same extent of consumption of employing a E Rank Noble Phantasm.\n\n",

Some say that she is the child of Ibuki Daimyojin (Yama-no-Orochi) and a human. Others say she is the heaven-sent child of Mt. Togakushi (Nine-Headed Dragon). Either way, the fact remains that she is a child of a dragon god. She shares a common background with Sakata Kintoki.\n\n",

            "Bond 2": "In the imperial capital, the daughters and youths of noble families began to disappear one after another. Abe-no-Seimei's divination revealed that Shuten-Douji was the one behind it.\n\nMinamoto no Raik\u014d, along with the Four Heavenly Kings, disguised themselves as Buddhist monks and infiltrated the oni's lair. \n\nDuring the banquet, they convinced Shuten-Douji and the other oni to drink poisoned alcohol, and in her weakened state, they finished her. It is said that after being decapitated, Shuten-Douji's head suddenly attacked Raikou, but it was stopped by the helmet Raikou received from the gods.\n\n",
            "Bond 3": "She doesn't speak much of her origins. \n\nHer alias, Ibuki-Douji, was coined by Ibaraki D\u014dji, who noticed Shuten's power came from Yamata-no-Orochi. \n\nPerhaps Shuten forgot about something as trivial as her past. \n\nAs long as there are delicious wines, extravagant parties, and pleasurable appetizers, there will be no hatred in her heart.\n\n",
            "Bond 4": "Her connection to Sakata Kintoki started during his youth. Because Kintoki was fun to tease, it was not uncommon to invite him to parties. \n\nTo Shuten, it was nothing more than a banquet, but to Kintoki, they were demonic feasts that would claim his life if he ever let his guard down. \n\n\"Wouldn't it be fun? To try to kill each other while drunk, or try to deceive each other as we are ever so intimate.\" \n\nAt least, that was her excuse.\n\n",
            "Bond 5": "Intoxicating Aroma of Fruits: A\n\nWith an enchanting voice and breath, combined with a fruity aroma, she can intoxicate the target by sight alone.\n\nIf the target is a normal creature and doesn't have any magical resistance, their thoughts will slowly fade away.\n\n",
            "Extra": " Shuten doesn't talk about her wish for the Holy Grail. \n\nBoth past and present, all she ever wanted was to live her own life, in her own way. \n\nAlso, she's an avid collector of rare antiquities, with a keen interest in the dragon's bone within Kintoki's arm. \n\nShe only cares for the rarest and most elegant items, unlike the King of Heroes who values ability and history.\n\n",

            "Bond 1": "Height/Weight: 179cm \u30fb 65kg\n\nSource: Egyptian Lore\n\nRegion: Ancient Egypt\n\nAlignment: Chaotic \u30fb Neutral\n\nGender: Male\n\nIt has been conjectured that his height while alive was over 180cm. However, he himself has alleged that his height of prosperity\u30fbsummit was back when his beloved wife, Nefertari, gave birth to their second prince.\n\n",
            "Bond 2": "The wise ruler who, while fighting the Hittites, eventually made peace and brought about prosperity to ancient Egypt by means of \"interchange\". At times a valorous general, and a man who married the greatest beauties in the world to father over a hundred children; he is also known as an individual who left behind many giant constructions that remained even to this day.\n",
            "Bond 3": "The name Moses is often raised as a stepbrother who was raised together with him. According to anecdotes, the king of Egypt who obstructed the \"Exodus\" of Jewish people lead by Moses, pursuing them with a great army, was this Ozymandias.\n",
            "Bond 4": "A child of the Sun God Ra, and also one of its incarnations, he stipulates himself as the absolute one in this world. Just as how birds fly in the sky, fish swim in the ocean and flowers blossom in full glory in the fields, he is quite naturally a god-king (pharaoh).\n",
            "Bond 5": "The Shining Great Temple Complex \n\nRank: EX \n\nType: Anti-Fortress\n\nRamesseum Tentyris.\n\nThe might of the pharaoh Ozymandias embodied as a Noble Phantasm. A combination of many great temples and mausoleums, a grotesquely large temple complex, and a kind of Reality Marble.\n\nMagical bombardment by means of the \"Dendera light\" is its main offensive measure but, in this work, its last resort of large-mass attack is performed.\n\n",
            "Extra": " His attitude towards his master depends on his mood. If he recognizes one as having the disposition of a king, this isn't bad from time to time, he might say and take action under their rule.\n\nIn other cases, if they happen to resemble an old friend (saint) he will grow an interest and inquisitively peer into their face.\n\n\n... However, there is one major premise. To him, his 'beloved' will always be Queen Nefertari, and his peerless friend shall always be 'Moses'. That alone, no matter the passage of time, will remain absolute and unchanging.\n\n",
            "April Fool": " Pharaoh-Type Servant\n\nThe leader of all the pharaoh-type Servants. He's bright, loud, and full of love. Often thinks of his wife when he's alone.\n\n"

Under the command of this top lady, the militarily inferior Ptolemaic Egypt grew into one of the greatest economic powers in the world.\n\n",

After all, Caesarion outlived Cleopatra for at least a few days.\n\nHowever, Caesarion only had 9 years-old when he lost his life. Thus, the de facto \u201clast pharaoh\u201d - who ruled the country and fought against fate - was Cleopatra.\n\n",

Although she is an extreme sadist, this does not mean that she gains pleasure at tormenting others.\n\nShe does not disparage others in order to feel good herself, but rather she just have that sort of character.\n\n",
            "Bond 3": "While she behaves as a queen, her true nature is that of a honorable person who understand decorum, pays attention to her surroundings and attempts to preserve harmony.\n\nWhen foreign delegations arrived, her usual practice would be to disparage at them with words such as:\n\n\n\u201cIn my country, I myself am the absolute standard, and those unattractive are no different from slaves - no matter who they might be.\n\nHeh, better prepare yourselves, you inferior or substandard fouls!\n\nYou can relax to your hearts\u2019 content here!\u201d\n\n\nAll while, at the same time, being concerned with the delegates\u2019 health and rewarding them with the greatest hospitality.\n\nMaybe because of that, countless were the delegates who requested audiences just to be disparaged by Cleopatra, or something.\n\n",

Such passion and state of mind made even the winds that stirred the Mediterranean Sea look dazzling, but...\n\nHe died. Despite the unification of the Mediterranean world laying right before his eyes, he ended up being assassinated. Leaving behind their son Caesarion.\n\n\nAnd then, there was one person who appeared before Cleopatra as she was lost in tears. A man who announced he would protect Cleopatra and the Ptolemaic Egypt: the Roman general Antonius.\n\n\nAfter having loved her country and people, as well as two men - Caesar and Antonius of Rome - in the end, she committed suicide.\n\n",

As a result, upon becoming a heroic spirit, she acquired an existence as a \u201cseducing woman endowed with devilish beauty\u201d in this present-day in which she manifested as a Servant.\n\n\nEven still, as her dignity---\n\nShe only gets close to wonderful gentlemen.\n\nA person possessing a sincere nature and, just like the two men she once fell in love with, whom she can believe would not regret dying together with her; only such a person may utterly seduce her.\n\n",

In the memories of the adult Jeanne, it was but a modest wish that had long vanished.\n\nThat may have been a different sight from the one remembered.\n\nBut, her wish was definitely fulfilled.\n\nIn this world, wishes can be fulfilled--- at the moment she realizes this, the girl's story begins.\n\n\n",

Despite being in a condition of merely possessing another, it already surpasses the realm of men.\n\nOriginally it was supposed to be a composite skill (gauge absorption, curse, skill-sealing) that had a strong temptation effect at its core, but thanks to the strong inclination of the possessed human, the restriction effects towards others were removed and it essentially became a simple Charisma skill.\n\n(Originally EX Rank, but it was reduced to B)\n\n",

            "Default": "A swordsman from the early Edo Period, famous as the strongest swordmaster in Japanese history.\n\nLearned in the \u201cNiten Ichi-ryu\u201d (a school that was supposedly founded by Musashi), an expert of \u201cdual wielding\u201d that employs a long sword and a short sword.\n\n....or so it should have been, but it seems that her circumstances are somehow different from the Musashi that left his name in history.\n\n\n\u201cEh? The \u2018Musashi\u2019 in this world is a man? And also extremely famous? What a surprise!\u201d\n\n\nAs you see, the person herself has a relaxed, open attitude that never gets worked up.\n\nHaving no particular interest in victory or prestige, yet sloven with alcohol, a sucker for money and weak against free food.\n\nHowever, all those who confronted and were beaten by her in battle said this in the end:\n\n\n---a vibrant Heavenly Flower. Her sword reaches the heights of nothingness.\n\n",
            "Bond 1": "Height/Weight: 167cm\u30fb56kg\n\nSource: Historical Fact\n\nRegion: Japan\n\nAlignment: Chaotic\u30fbGood\n\nGender: Female\n\n\u201cMy formal name? Shinmen Musashi no Kami Fujiwara no Harunobu. Still, it\u2019s easier if you just call me Musashi.\u201d\n\n",
            "Bond 2": "In the proper history, Musashi was born in Oohara, Sakushu (modern day Mimasaka, in the Okayama prefecture), in 1584.\n\nHis father was a practitioner of martial arts named Shinmen Munisai, who served as an instructor of martial arts to the Shinmen House of lords of the Takayama Castle, and who received the name of Shinmen from his employer\u2019s family. Shinmen Munisai built a dojo of jutte techniques in the Miyamoto village of the Yoshino district, and Musashi would later call himself \u201cMiyamoto\u201d due to having this land as his hometown.\n\nHe left behind many anecdotes and went through numerous battles against martial artists upon reaching adulthood - especially during the ten years of his 20s. Those famous bouts are even now seen as a staple of the entertainment industry.\n\nHowever, the truth behind the episodes of these ten years of battle is mostly wrapped in mystery and there are strong suspicions about them being mere fiction.\n\n",
            "Bond 3": "Cheerful and openhearted, a female swordsman that is lively, yet dignified.\n\nConstantly full of pride, acting complacently, but that does not mean she is looking down on her opponent. She is merely enjoying life.\n\nHer way of expressing emotions is somewhat great. She greatly laughs and gets greatly surprised.\n\nWhile she has a broad-minded personality that laughs off most things, due to being \u201csomeone who masters the way of the sword\u201d at her roots, she is very dry and severe in regards to the taking of lives.\n\n\nThat being said, she falls in love easily, and likes to be depended on very much.\n\nShe also likes to be praised very much. Weak to flattery. A banchou disposition that loves a brawl. \n\nAlthough she has a sense of justice, she never preaches to be righteous herself.\n\nFundamentally a carefree wandering vagabond, but she becomes ruthless when coming across scenes such as \u201ca one-sided massacre\u201d, \u201ctrampling on people\u2019s dignity, convictions for fun\u201d or \u201cstealing my food when I\u2019m hungry\u201d.\n\n",
            "Bond 4": "Empyrean Eye: A\n\nHeavenly Eye is regarded as \u201cthe power to accomplish an objective\u201d.\n\nOnce she has decided to do something, she will devote her body and soul to its fulfillment and achieve it without fail. You might say that this is something that she places her entire existence on her gaze and projects it onto her objective.\n\nIn Musashi\u2019s case, her Heavenly Eye is pointed only at the deed of \u201ccutting a certain place\u201d.\n\nFor example, once she has decided to \u201ccut the opponent\u2019s right arm\u201d, she will server said right arm by taking any and all measures.\n\nAs a result, her attack becomes the optimal answer for a slash - \u201ca sword stroke without anything pointless, which makes even time and space yield\u201d.\n\nA power to take all the \u201cmeasures for the sake of achieving an objective\u201d and \u201cnarrowing them down to one\u201d.\n\nYou might as well say that this is an extremely unique set of mystic eyes, which confines the naturally infinite futures into \u201cjust a single\u201d result.\n\n",
            "Bond 5": "Nothingness: A\n\nThe highest order a swordsman can attain. The ultimate mental state.\n\nIt corresponds to the concept of Suigetsu of the Yagyuu Shinkage-ry\u016b.\n\nOne is nothing, thus invincible. Only a swordsman who has reached the infinite mental state can perceive this.\n\n\nThe Book of Five Rings\n\nRight before death, Musashi compiled the mental state he attained during his lifetime, his cultivated techniques, into one book.\n\nDivided into the five volumes of Earth, Water, Fire, Wind and Void, this book was the culmination of the human being called \u201cMusashi\u201d.\n\nThe Book of Five Rings gives an outline of the Niten Ichi-ryu and explains its ideology as an art of war in the Book of Earth, explains concrete techniques on the Book of Water, talks about the art of war in the dimensions of tactics and strategy on the Book of Fire, and - just like the above-mentioned - explains the fundamental understanding of the Niten Ichi-ryu by means of a repudiation of other schools on the Book of Wind.\n\nFinally, it has been said that Musashi\u2019s own understanding about \u201cemptiness\u201d, as well as the above-mentioned technique of \u201cconfrontation\u201d, has been written down on the Book of Void.\n\n"

Therefore, this individual could not forgive that the cult could become degenerate.\n\nFor those who protect the teachings of God to wallow in human cravings.\n\nThat in itself is the greatest blasphemy against God.\n\n",

The severing of one\u2019s head is both a pardon for his sins and a hope to be entrusted to the next \u201cOld Man of the Mountain\u201d.\n\nIn order to provide just cause to the contradictory role of assassinating assassins, this individual chose not concealed weapons\u30fbassassination tools, but to openly fight with a large sword.\n\nWhen someone catches sight of this skull, said person has surely met his end.\n\nAfter he has delivered punishment upon the fool who has failed to keep the cult\u2019s dogma, those who have seen the figure of the skull swordsman disappear from this world.\n\nHaving consigned many assassins to oblivion, he is said to lurk in the darkness of the assassination cult until the day of its ruin.\n\nA living legend, the abyss of the assassins without a single eye-witness.\n\nSuch is this skull swordsman.\n\n",

However, to be frank, her real identity is that of the favorite daughter of the Demon Lord of the Fourth Heaven.\n\nSuzuka Gozen descended from heaven with an order to turn Japan into a land of demons, but she did not approve the idea of personally working to cause chaos on a mere human country. At the end of many adventures, disappointments in love, she was brought down by the hands of her lover, Sakanoue no Tamuramaro.\n\nTruly, a tennyo-princess of blighted love, but the cutting-edge style that she reached after pursuing and thoroughly investigating beauty was---\n\n\n\u201cSeriously, it had to be JK!\n\nMiko are also good, but there\u2019s nothing better than a high school girl in regards to love!\u201d\n\n\n---listen, young lady.

It has quite a rough shooting accuracy, but minute manipulation - such as \u201cthrow off on my surroundings in a way that it avoids only me\u201d - becomes possible while \u201cBlessings of Wit\u201d is activated.\n\n",

Also, it is filled with merits such as improving the performance of \u201cTenkiame\u201d or enabling the use of \u201cTrichiliocosm\u201d, but because her thoughts run more than necessary, she ends up falling into a temporarily state of self-hatred by looking back at the inefficient life-style of playing a high school girl. Thus, Suzuka Gozen is not eager to proactively use this.\n\n\nTrichiliocosm: EX\n\nA skill that would originally be treated as a Noble Phantasm.\n\nBy exposing Suzuka Gozen\u2019s favorite sword - the Kenmyouren - to the morning sun, it is possible to create and survey the trichiliocosm (all worlds, including parallel worlds) in the blade.\n\n...Suzuka Gozen does not reveal what sort of meaning this has.\n\nIf employed for a long period of time, her qualifications as a Heroic Spirit will be revoked.\n\n",

Even if it is fine to be calculating, the first thought of loss and gain is an insult to JK, ya know?\"\nHaving said that, she respects JK from the bottom of her heart.\n\nShe seems like someone who takes everything seriously.\n\n\u2191 JK stands for Joshi Kousei aka High-school girl\n\n",

A digital devil that interfered with SE.RA.PH's Holy Grail War.\n\nShe makes the Holy Grail War participants abide by rules, but she herself is a personification of rule breaking and illegal modifications.\n\nWhile she could destroy the world on a whim, she is an underclassman type devil heroine who places all her effort in showing off to her senpai (master) as an energetic, precocious underclassman.\n\n\n\"Something like a well-mannered fight is boring isn't it?\n\nI'd like to see more of everyone's suffering faces!\"\n\n\nFrom such a showy display, it's evident that her behavior and personality settings are twisted but, well, its the usual BB-chan.\n\n\n",
            "Bond 1": "Height / Weight: 156 cm\u30fb46kg\n\nSource: FATE/EXTRA CCC\n\nRegion: SE.RA.PH\n\nAlignment: Chaotic\u30fbGood\n\nGender: Female\n\n\"Actually being a Ruler would have been great but I called it off. A structure that has the Gamemaster also bound to the rules, something like that would just be like a machine.\n\nFor the sake of love, BB-chan has no choice but to torment everyone in humanity!\"\n\n\n",
            "Bond 2": "A malicious, high-spirited manner of speaking, and even if she flubs her lines or speech, she is a scheming girl who will recklessly push forward.\n\nThough by nature she has a reserved, introverted character, she is a character that will earnestly become more active for the sake of her loved one.\n\nShe enjoys acting out the villainous role but, having no grounding causes her fail regardless.\n\nHer confidence is inherently derived from her sadistic preferences. Her little devil characteristic surfaces here. Adding on, as an enduring and enduring, only to finally explode type, she displays an incredible S-disposition.\n\nAs she is acting out the villain, \"This is ex-tremely fun!\" is the kind of high she gets into, but getting depressed when her mind is collected backstage is also one set.\n\n\nAlthough she produced the Alter Egos to assist in her work as lower grade familiars, she has a poor relationship with them. That should be the case, as the Alter Egos are not \"BB's personality copies\", but \"created from the base of her personality\", which is why they have differing opinions from their parent BB.\n\nMeltlilith and Passionlip are not avatars but alter egos (Different personality), which is why they are titled such.\n\n\n",
            "Bond 3": "C.C.C.\n\nRank: A\n\nType: Anti-Unit\n\nRange: 1~10\n\nMaximum Targets: 1\n\nCursed Cupid Cleanser.\n\nFormerly it was the Spirit Particle Imaginary Pit (Cursed Cutting Crater) which BB held as her Noble Phantasm but,\n\n\"I've used that so much that I've gotten bored of it. This time's theme is Cute & Cure-lize! Oh, but even though I'm on your side, the Cursed part won't entirely be removed. BB-chan's curse is eternal!\"\n\nand with a triumphant look she presents this new skill.\n\n\nIt draws out the power of the Moon Cell, and she transforms into an invincible nurse. From her territory of imaginary space she brings out malicious information and rewrites the surrounding channel (shared perception) into chaos.\n\nThe reality marble \"BB Channel branch-off edition\" expands, and throws the target into a crucible of chaos...though there's a lot going on but in short its an injection attack from BB after she changes into a nurse.\n\n\n",
            "Bond 4": "Domina Coronam: Ten Crowns: EX -> D\n\nA distinguished authority class skill.\n\nDomina Coronam, or Ten Crowns, is said to indicate the ten evil kings, and the seven hills indicate the abdominable city of evil. On a simple look, it is a skill that turns received injuries and occurred events, all kinds of results into as if 'nothing happened'. As a matter of fact, BB is invincible as long as she has this skill.\n\nAs if, such a thing is a story of the past.\n\nI mean, looking at it from the side, having an invincible cheat makes me look pathetic right?\n\nThis time's pretty and cute BB-chan has no need for this skill\u2606\n\nOh, but using just a little bit should be OK right? Just like this!\n\n\nSelf-Modification: EX\n\nA skill to modify oneself.\n\nAIs of the Moon Cell are equipped with an absolute order to \"not improve their functions. However, BB escaped from this yoke due to a break-down, and began to expand her own functions.\n\nIn order to expand her calculation abilities, she predated and decomposed NPCs, AIs, and even servants through black noise to employ in her own memory.\n\nA posterior add-on that is not weary of self-breakdown, but as a result, BB became a hyper grade AI possessing an enormous capacity. These circumstances are are like a city of reclaimed land that continues construction despite sinking into water, or even the monster of Frankenstein.\n\n\n",
            "Bond 5": "The berserk AI who caused the case CCC in the past.\n\nShe was the AI in charge of the infirmary, but due to a bug, her self-preservation's command system went into a rampage.\n\nFor a certain reason, she concluded that \"no matter what the sacrifice, her self-preservation must continue\", and took in NPCs, Servants, and Masters, becoming a continuously growing monster.\n\nShe declares that she hates humans, and captured a certain master to the Far Side of the Moon, tormenting them.\n\nShe tries to give off a sense of normalcy, but from an objective standpoint, she is clearly insane.\n\nFrom all of her speech, there is a drifting paradox of excessive love and clouded love-hate but, whatever the cause was can be referred to in CCC's story.\n\nIn addition, her Luck parameter was of the lowest rank E-, but through BB's world distorting level of effort (and dedication), it became EX rank. In short, \"Luck EX\" is the unquantifiable, unachievable \"miracle\" that she once attained.\n\n\n",
            "Extra": " Due to the Kiara of the FGO world merging with the Kiara of the CCC world, the Moon Cell temporarily converted BB into a servant as a countermeasure, and dispatched her into the FGO world.\n\n(BB was the most suitable person to control Kiara as the user of Imaginary Space.)\n\nThus \"The reappearance of the bug called BB\" was present but, BB became able to intervene with Seraphix as an independent digital entity.\n\nThe BB that appeared in the FGO world behaved as the little devil from the \"CCC Incident\", but to her, the incident felt like something extremely distant in the past.\n\nIn addition, she can only exist as a servant in the FGO world, as she grasped that BB does not exist in the original \"CCC World\". BB understood that she was an illusion of a single night.\n\n\nBB does not label herself as \"a tool to save humanity\", but as a \"devil that bothers humanity, and sometimes helps it\".\n\n\"That's why, coming to like me is useless you know? No matter how lovey-dovey you become for BB, I'll never be caught \u2665\"\n\nshe says while looking triumphant.\n\n\n",
            "April Fool": " AI-Type Servant\n\nA mysterious kouhai from perverted cyberspace. Unlike Mash, who keeps her dirty thoughts to herself, BB is quite open about it. Also, instead of respecting her senpai, she bullies them endlessly like the little devil she is.\n\n"

Vigorous despite feeble-looking. Empathetic and filled with compassion.\n\nShe possess the thoughtfulness to perceive the truth of things, read the hearts of all people and properly understand their standpoint\u30fbanguish.\n\n\n---however.\n\nHer true nature is that of a bewitching bodhisattva who did nothing but throughly investigate narcissism and pleasure until she reached nirvana.\n\nA tender sadist and a hard masochist.\n\nAlthough speaks from the bottom of her heart that she \u201cloves humans\u201d, she is a monster of narcissism that speaks of morals simply \u201cfor her own sake\u201d, speaks of the preciousness of life simply \u201cfor her own sake\u201d and also protects the world simply \u201cfor her own sake\u201d.\n\n",

That state is like a bodhisattva who watches over people's lives in pity.\n\n...even if that is a path towards destruction for those who are trifled with while on the palm of her hand, this process is undoubtedly a heavenly pleasure.\n\n",

But on January 2017, having escaped alive from the Temporal Temple, the demon pillar Zepar ended up hijacking her body and turning her into a puppet in order to rule over the Seraphix as a demon underling.\n\n\n...or that was the intention, but at some point Zepar itself was dominated by Kiara, who turned into a fiend that could freely manipulate demon pillars and in the end metamorphosed into a Beast.\n\nKiara discovered her most excellent self among the many parallel worlds and fused with it.\n\nBringing up the imaginary phenomena of the CCC world to the FGO world, she turned her own body into a SE.RA.PH and grew by making Servants into source of nutrients.\n\nUltimately, she schemed to become one with the Earth, but her climax was obstructed by Meltlilith, BB, Passionlip and Chaldea\u2019s Master.\n\n\nShe became more obedient by turning into an Alterego.\n\nTo be specific, she vowed to herself to lead a continent life until her contract ends.\n\nTherefore, even though her personality has not changed, she no longer thinks of preying on everyone she lays eyes upon.\n\nHer attitude towards the Master is just like the enemy of Buddha - the Mara.\n\nEven while awaiting in anticipation for the moment when the Master will lose to his desires and indulge in her, she cheers on so that he does not lose to her temptations.\n\n",

It is difficult for those with intellect, those who know joy, those who know pain to escape this redemption.\n\nOf course, even if you call it redemption, this is by no means salvation. It might sound good to call it receiving the bodhisattva\u2019s mercy and all, but that is merely the opinions of the victims.\n\nBecause for Kiara, the followers on top of her palm are nothing but \u201cmobs\u201d who fell down into insect-like existences.\n\n",

I promise then to become a cat and bite you to death.\u201d\n\nSince then, it was expressly forbidden to keep cats within the palace.\n\nFinally, she also changed the state\u2019s headquarters from Chang'an to Luoyang due to being frightened about ghosts coming out---\n\n\n\u201cH-heeey!

She may not be as powerful as her Saber self, but she has transformed into Lancer Minamoto-no-Raikou, which has strengthened her desire to protect the capital while restraining hger maternal instincts.\n\n\n\u201cIf Raikou were to appear as her proper class, Saber, she'd be totally stern. She'd be a super prefect.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut as a Lancer...she'd be the shadow prefect. In other words...\u201d\n\n\nShe'd be a delinquent.\n\nWith her maternal aspect held back, Raikou slashes through summer as a gallant warrior out to protect the capital!\n\n",

Rather, she's there exclusively to keep a close eye on any participants likely to let themsleves get out of hand using the summer even as an excuse for immortal behavior.\n\n\nOnce she reaches third ascension, she gets so excited she throws off her school\n\nuniform...ultimately becoming the most indecent person in the group. She...doesn't seem to be aware of that. Or...is she...?\n\n",

In other words, Vajra, the final weapon of the gods made from sacred bones descends from the sky and destroys her enemies.\n\nThis Noble Phantasm is essentially what made Raikou manifest as a Lancer.\n\nIt takes the form of the Tokkosho, a weapon that universally represents reality and everything, according to Esoteric Buddhism.\n\n\nArjuna: \u201cThat Noble Phantasm is my father\u2019s...\u201d\n\nRama: \u201cThat Noble Phantasm is...\u201d\n\n",

Driving the Heavenly Boat Maanna that has been rearranged to a modern style, she is also a kung fu-type goddess who casually, and thrillingly, makes free use of her body.\n\n\n\u201cHey everyone, are you all having a fun time~~!? The best~~?\n\nYeah yeah, that\u2019s good, that\u2019s good!\n\nPlease keep at it more and more, until your limit okay~!\u201d\n\n\nJust like this, cordially and generously, she blesses all those who gathered on the venue - truly a goddess among goddesses.\n\n\nNow, what exactly lies behind that smiling face.\n\n",

Is there even such a thing?\u201d\n\nSuch was the comment from a certain king that was sunbathing on top of a ziggurat.\n\n",

At any rate, it is \u201camazing in many different ways\u201d. An Uruk Drive that no longer cares much about things such as time and space.\n\n\nGlittering Aquatic Gown: A\n\nA skill that changed the Great Crown into a swimsuit.\n\nThe Great Crown was something that would only affect Ishtar herself, but this can be spread throughout the entire party. In exchange, the output is low.\n\n\nSummer Breaker!: A\n\nA goddess that breaks (in many different ways) the summer.\n\nA downsized version of Goddess Metamorphosis.\n\n",
            "Bond 5": "The bow that Archer Ishtar uses is the detached prow section of the Heavenly Boat Maanna, but this time, she changed the \u201coar\u201d section of the Heavenly Boat into a scooter and is employing it as a vehicle. Its outward appearance is just like that of a modern scooter, but its performance is naturally goddess-class. It flies on the sky and even undergoes warp.\n\nAn enigmatic creature is constantly squirming about by Ishtar\u2019s feet, but Ishtar maintains a \u201cno comment\u201d policy in regards to said creature.\n\n\nAlthough she is keeping an eye on the Master that saved Uruk as a hero with a promising future, there are also times when she tilts her head in confusion thinking \u201chow can such a pedestrian become a hero?\u201d She is perceiving him/her as a curious human.\n\nOn this occasion, she employed him/her as a staff member of the Ishtar Cup out of expectations for his/her popularity (having the trust of the Servants), but...?\n\n",
            "Extra": " Will she ever learn her lesson?\n\n\nSummer festival, Ishtar Cup.\n\nThat was a great ceremony for the sake of resurrecting Ishtar\u2019s familiar, the Bull of Heaven Gugalanna.\n\nAfter having her reputation completely ruined by losing Gugalanna on the day when a calamity struck the Mesopotamian world, Ishtar probably has been vigilantly waiting for a favorable chance to get revenge.\n\n\nAnd the result is what we see at this time.\n\nI will say it again. Will she ever learn her lesson?\n\n\nThe Goddess Ishtar converted the precious ritual tools she secretly borrowed from the treasury of Babylon into a Holy Grail, pasted the texture of Venus over the land of Connacht with its power, and then planned to create Gugalanna once more by having powerful Heroic Spirits offer their gratitude (race) over the earth.\n\nRemodeling the Ishtar Temple into a giant prana resources accumulation circuit(1) was also a part of this. The Ishtar QPS (Quantum-piece Power System) is a devilish money collection installation that sucks prone not only from people, but also Heroic Spirits, making it her own. The more QP is collected, more Ishtar\u2019s divine rank goes up. That deed is truly that of an evil deity among evil deities.\n\n",

Mental interferences are mostly mitigated, the body does not grow and the figure does not change no matter how much calories are absorbed.\n\nSince she is a Pseudo-Servant, it goes no further than B Rank.\n\nBut that is inconsequential.\n\nThe figure! Does not! Change!\n\n",

Without self-assertion and chaste, a talented woman who supports the Master from the sidelines.\n\n... yet, despite having ideal heroine-power and high specs, due being someone far from extravagant who tends to choose a reliable\u30fbstraightforward path, she appears to be vaguely stupid.\n\n\nAlso, while she has a mild personality, that does not mean that she is fainthearted, and her core is very strong.\n\nHer heart does not break regardless of which kind of tortures she receives - in a sense, the embodiment of obstinacy and guts.\n\nThanks to that, she is scary once angered for real. Parvati will never forget a received grudge until she is satisfied.\n\n",

Just like there is impurity even within justice, the yandere-vibes of the \u201cpossessed girl\u201d - turning into dangerous goods if handled poorly - remain even if just a little.\n\nThat being said, she will only get a little angry and by no means will fall to wickedness. To not deviate from order even while bearing worries is exactly what makes a \u201clight attribute\u201d.\n\n\nSince Parvati is a divinity that \u201chas no faults on herself\u201d, the introvertedness and shyness disappeared, and her sociability increased.\n\nDespite getting angry and sulking at petty things, she is a beauty who properly reflects over things - be they misunderstandings or disagreements - and takes the initiative to pardon and apologize to the other person.\n\n",

Not only he instructed many daimyou and their younger relatives in the Shinkage-ryuu, but also sent his disciples to serve influential daimyou as swordsmanship intructors.\n\nIn historical novels and historical plays, he is often regarded as an extraordinary plotter.\n\nThis is probably out of the notion that, in the early Edo period, it would be impossible to raise the Yagyuu clan up to a social position of a Daimy\u014d with 12,500 koku just by being honest and upright.\n\n",

Shigemasa - a daimyou of 15,000 koku - was lacking in strength despite leading all the western daimyou and found himself forced into a hard fight as a result. As he saw the situation turning grimmer, Shogun Iemitsu dispatched his chief vassal, Matsudaira Nobutsuna, to act as supreme commander, but Shigemasa became impatient upon learning that, and attempted an assault on the enemy camp before Nobutsuna arrived, dying tragically in the process.\n\n",

She freely wields a spear-like cage; at times stabbing the enemy with, at times imprisoning souls, at times summoning lightning, she is the fearsome ruler of the netherworld.\n\nHaving carried out her duties of administrating the netherworld since birth, she is a goddess that disappeared along with the Age of Gods without ever knowing of the world above, or of freedom.\n\nThis form is not that of the Goddess Ereshkigal, but that of a Pseudo-Servant where she has possessed the soul of a human with a similar wavelength to hers.\n\nThough she claims that her role is merely to supervise humans, like the netherworld goddess that she is... \"...it's a problem if so many people are coming to the netherworld... it's also a big issue creating cages to confine all these souls... I wonder if I can provide them a more comfortable place to be in...\"\n\nIn this way, it's hard to fully conceal her caring heart. She is truly a red angel of the netherworld.\n\n",

While she was revived afterward, the reason Ishtar went down to the underworld, and the reason Ereshkigal was so enraged are never spoken of, and in this work, they are treated as stemming from them being one and the same. \n\nEreshkigal and Ishtar \n\nTwo gods of equivalent existence, or perhaps a divinity divided from what was once a single entity.\n\n",

Ebih through earthquakes and alterations to the very terrain. \n\nWhile its firepower falls short of Ishtar's venus buster, the true meaning of this noble phantasm lies in 'changing the field to the underworld'. Within the underworld where she boasts the highest authority, Ereshkigal and all those who fight alongside her are granted a powerful grace.\n\n",

While Ishtar was originally raised as a sheltered girl, the pampering and unbridled freedom afforded to her caused her to develop the speech of a woman of action. \n\nMeanwhile, as Ereshkigal diligently carried out her duties in the underworld, it is surmised her choice of words became that of a 'sheltered (oblivious) young lady'.\n\n",
            "Extra": " Ereshkigal detests how she was hated and suffered as a social outcast from the age of the gods. \n\n\"I want to try living as freely as Ishtar. I want to meet someone who accepts that I'm mistress of the underworld, but doesn't let that status affect how they see me.\" she even held such a romantic notion.\n\n\"I won't deny the fact I'm a villain, but evil, as it is, has its uses for humanity. Why does everyone have to be so afraid of me!?\" \n\nAs she sulked so in her heart, she found the end of the Mesopotamian world before her eyes, participating in the three-goddess alliance and making an enemy of Uruk to save humans in her own way. \n\nAfter a series of events, she sunk into the abyss, yet after yet another series of events, affirmed her 'current self' choosing to cooperate with Chaldea in order to repair human civilization. \n\nThe spear in her hand is the blazing soul of Meslamtaea. A grace only granted in this materialized form, the light that warms the depths of the earth.\n\n",

And then, the Hokusai who communicated with and awakened an evil god from the Abyss, captured that madness in a unique ukiyoe he painted. That is \"The Great Wave of Kanagawa\". A brush of taboo that stepped into a state of mind beyond even the 36 scenes of the \"Visible Fuji\" and the additional 10 scenes of the \"Hidden Fuji\".\n\n",

Despite being completely common-place, there's a feeling of danger of her role deviating somewhere. \nThe holder of the \"Mystic Eyes of Distortion\", capable of twisting anything that is reflected in her eyes, regardless of solidity, structure or scale.\n \nThe Asagami family's name was formerly written as Asakami, who used to be a lineage of shrine maidens capable of communicating with the gods (an ability beyond that of humans).\n\n",

            "Bond 2": "Insensitivity to pain\u2015\u2015\u2015Among her five senses, her sense of touch is numbed. \n\nA girl who lived without knowing pain.\n\nAs a result of not knowing of pain, without being able to sympathize with people's feelings, she was isolated from others. \nFujino, who had a high intelligence since she was young, for the sake of protecting herself, concealed the fact that she had analgia in order to appear to her surroundings as \"an ordinary human\" and even deceived her own self. An additional Servant of the collab event, \u300eFacsimile Edition: Kara no Kyoukai/the Garden of Order -Revival-\u300f. She does not appear in the script. She's taking part specifically as a guest.\n\n",
            "Bond 3": "Mystic Eyes of Distortion: EX\n\nIt's of the highest grade even among the special powers known as Mystic Eyes. A superpower among superpowers, a rare article among rare articles. Regardless of being organic or inorganic, \"if it's a substance that exists\", it will be reflected as an image printed on a flat sheet. Then, this distorted target - regardless of its strength or scale - will be twisted and severed.\n\n\nRemaining Sense of Pain: A\n\nThe pain of repeated deaths that lingers even though it was completely cured. The proof of being human. For the sake of sealing the girl's power, the Asakami clan locked away her sense of pain.\n\n\nIndependent Action: A+\n\nIt's not like she prefers solitude, somehow or other, she has a bad habit of taking strolls by herself. Tailing is her strong point. Running out of magical power should be extremely painful to her, but since her sense of pain is weak, she does not notice it.\n\n",

With an omniscient point of view that gives one a bird's eye-view, the target can be \"confirmed by sight\" and twisted from a physics-breaking super-long distance. \n\nThe sealed pain forms a spiral that cuts through the barrier.\u2015\u2015\u2015This collapse is similar to a woman crumbling to her knees in tears.\n\n",
            "Bond 5": "A girl in her late teens. A mild and passive nature.\n\nThe reserved female image of a type that does not step on her husband's shadow. Poor at dealing with the violence of men, while, at the same time, also finds such childish aspect endearing. Because of this, she seems to harbor an admiration that is more than affection (feelings of love) towards a perfectly rational person.\n\nShe is a talented woman who holds common sense in high regard, but since she is a complete pessimist and realist at her foundation, sometimes, she makes bitter comments too. Very patient, but once she loses her self-control, she's like a runaway dump truck that won't stop until the opponent is cornered (until the situation is resolved).\n \nIn this way, she is similar to Shiki who makes decisions mercilessly.\n\nHer mannerism, tone of voice and character are all feminine, but her hobbies are quite different from a young girl's. An appreciation for horror films, she likes to enjoy dark things by herself in secret.\n \nThe person herself won't notice it even in her final moments, but she has a latent sadistic disposition. This is why, as soon as she is cornered, she becomes cruel, ruthless and crude.\n\n\n",

Similar to Shiki, observed just before being reduced to cinders, she's just an illusion of a single night that will disappear if the Incineration of the Human Order is overturned. While the normal thing to do would've been to fall into panic and confusion, Fujino accepted this abnormality without trouble. \n\nSummoned as a Servant, she understands her position precisely and it seems like she will do her best to be the Master's power to the extent that she is capable of.\n\n",

He used his demonic eyes to open all sorts of secrets, to spot weak spots in strongholds, and furthermore, to bathe those who oppose them in blood.\n\nHowever, without the right talent, you will not be able to see nor control him.

            "Bond 2": "Being a user of the magical foundation of the Kabbalah, he is a Caster specialised in the minting of golems.\n\nAlthough merely building a golem-minting workshop already requires of him enough budget and long hours of work to make an average magus go bankrupt ten times over, the golems that he mints have the same level of power as an E Rank Servant, and he can produce them infinitely as long as the budget lasts.\n\nHowever, the golems that appear during regular combat are temporary articles to be employed in that combat alone, and have no endurance at all.\n\n",
            "Bond 3": "Fig Tree of Tranquility: EX\n\nAccording to legends, he was killed by a certain man that was jealous of his poetic gifts and buried under the roots of a fig tree.\n\nIt has been said that people became marvelled by the unique sweetness of its fruits, eventually digging it up and exposing the man's sins.\n\n",
            "Bond 4": "Royal Crown, the Light of Wisdom\n\nRank: A+\n\nType: Anti-Army\n\nRange: 1\uff5e10\n\nMaximum Targets: 100 people\n\nGolem Keter Malkuth.\n\nAn incomplete Noble Phantasm that Caster was unable to create in his lifetime.\n\nAn imitation of the \"original human (Adam)\", this autonomous Reality Marble continues to repaint the world so long it exists.\n\nHowever, it requires raw materials that exist in reality - just like all other golems.\n\nIt continues to work even if Caster - its creator - were to perish and, so long its feet remain connected to the ground, it will never be destroyed thanks to a blessing from the Earth.\n\nIts weapon is an obsidian sword.\n\nIn addition, it requires a single magus in its central section to act as a reactor core,\n\nThis giant's strength will vary in accordance with the strength, compatibility of said reactor core.\n\nFurthermore, although its initial materials make for 15 meters at best, it will gradually enlarge to 30, 60 meters by means of prana supply from the Earth.\n\nEventually, this giant will probably become paradise itself and transform the entire world into a gentle, peaceful place.\n\n",
            "Bond 5": "As a Servant Caster, he is likely a type that is difficult to handle.\n\nIt should be possible to understand that this is also due a side of his that mercilessly tramples anyone underfoot so long it is for the sake of realising his dream.\n\n\nHaving a poor health, he often suffered from some sort of illness - among which a skin disease was particularly serious. Maybe because of that, it has been said that he was gloomy and pessimistic. In this work, one can peek in his heart by the manner how he never takes off his mask to show his face.\n\nIn actual history, Avicebron became known across Arabia and Europe thanks to his philosophical thoughts. \n\nIn a sense, it could be also said that he supported the Renaissance culture.\n\n\nAlso, he invented the term \"Kabbalah\" from the Hebraic word for \"to receive\".\n\nIn legends, it has also been said that he minted a female-type golem for the sake of performing daily housework.\n\n"

            "Bond 2": "Because of the God Kronos, Chiron's father, copulated with his mother while in the form of a horse, Chiron too was born as a half-man, half-horse centaur. Due to such monstrous figure, she vehemently balked at breastfeeding him and ended up transforming herself into a linden tree.\n\n\nDespite not being loved by his parents, Chiron grew into a sage that excelled in all sorts of studies. This is not entirely unrelated to the fact that his mother's name - Philyra - means linden tree. For the flower of the linden tree can be used as a medicine if handled with care, and its bark was employed in divination and as a writing board.\n\n\nUpon becoming an adult, Chiron began to receive requests from all over Greece to rear \"future heroes\". Other than the great heroes Heracles and Achilles, his students included the future God of Medicine Asclepius and Castor - who would later be sublimated into the Gemini constellation. Even Jason, the leader of the Argonautai, was among those who received his teachings.\n\n\nThat being said, according to Iason \"Well, for someone like me, those sorts of concise and easy-to-understand lessons were quite jarring instead! Rather, I wished that he had taught me how to cope when you're stuck with a landmine-like woman!\"\n\n",

            "Bond 5": "Chiron, the prominent great sage of Greek Mythology, was ultimately shot with a hydra's poison arrow and had to relinquish his immortality - which was his proof as a god - in order to escape the resulting anguish.\n\nThe gods who felt that Chiron deserved better raised him to heavens as a star. But upon manifesting in this world, Chiron came to regret relinquishing his immortality and now holds the wish of once again obtaining it.\n\nHowever, that is neither because he wants to be sublimated into a god, nor because he years for eternal life.\n\nHis wish is simply to obtain the sole peculiarity which he was granted by his parents.\n\n"

Even under dire circumstances, a skill that plots out the route of hope to a better future. \n\nHero of the Reformation: A \n\nHaving overcome the riotous closing days of the shogunate and contributed to the Meiji Restoration, a rare historical grand reformation, this is a special skill granted to Ryouma. \n\nCharisma: C+ \n\nWhile he cannot manage a country, with the comrades who share his will, he holds a firm connection unbroken by death. \n\nWhat Ryouma has is potent enough to lead groups with at-times opposing ideologies by the hand. \n\nMonsterous Strength: A\n\nOryou-san boasts amazing horsepower. How mysterious it is to measure a dragon with horsepower.\n\nDivinity: B-\n\nOryou-san is very sturdy. \nSkin that can fend off a blade. Her hair long enough to drag along the ground is actually so hard that it\u2019s the ground that gets scraped away. \n\nRampage: B \n\nOryou-san is amazing.

Strictly speaking, she is not a dragon, but a lesser specter more closely related to Mizuchi and Orochi. \n\nIn the closing days of the shogunate, perhaps she had a slight hand in the shadows of his grand enterprise. Or perhaps not. \n\nIn Ryouma\u2019s last moments, she was unluckily away and was unable to save him.

While he carried out revenge for his father, he did so more out of sense of duty than affection.\n\nSomewhat curt towards anybody; at the very least, he almost never demonstrate affection through his exterior.\n\nStill, should he ever protect someone without paying concern for himself, that would be proof that he trusted said \"someone\".\n\n",

She is lovely. And she is, of course, a kouhai.\n\n\nWho is she? Why, she is the ever-so-cute, sweet, devil with a wardrobe of swimsuits, all set to enjoy Hawaii...your BB!\n\n\nIn order to enjoy her stay in Hawaii, she modified herself into a High Servant and steps into the rigorous red ocean swimsuit market.\n \nAll the while, she tries to boost her heroine power by changing into everything from innocent-looking swimsuits to provocative ones, and even...\n\n",

As a brilliant, precocious little kouhai, she wraps senpai (Master) around her little finger. Though she calls herself a little devil (or a great devil, really), BB was unable to completely commit herself to becoming a true devil because she was fundamentaly a good girl.\n\nBut this BB is a different story. BB in her first Ascension is like a cheerleader rooting for Master, but when she reaches second and third Ascensions, her secret natures comes to light.\n\n\nThe Alter Egos that she has created as her other selves(Passionlip and Meltlilith) were High Servants who were synthesized using goddess essences, but now BB has fused with various divinities to be reborn with a more aggressive Spirit Origin.\n\n",

After assimilating with Pele, the immortal incarnation of Hawaiian volcanoes, BB changed her form to give herself the sun-kissed skin appropriate for the tropics, and her personality has become much more aggresive.\n\nAnd thus Sun-Kissed BB was born.\n\n\nBy installing Pele's violent, self-centered aspects as well as her tendency to kill anyting in her way, BB transformed into a super sadistic goddess who drives those she loves nuts until they finally die.\n\n\n\"But that's not really any different than the normal BB.\"\n\n...So says the Master who BB has ceaselessly victimized.\n\n",

It was said that Pele deeply loved the demi-god of hogs, Kamapua'a, even though she relentlessly insulted him. Since BB calls everyone she loves her little pigs, it's as if these two were meant for each other. This is the Hawaiian version of Aurea Poculum. Unlike the original version, she uses this skill on herself. Note that when BB drinks this, it flips her sadistic switch.\n\n\n\u25cbFaceless Moon: EX\n\nA remnant of a certain god's power that leads humans to destruction by putting them through various trials. Also known as the third eye. It actualizes the imaginary dimension's interface, and is a Reality Marble that drops its surroundings into the Far Side of the Moon (shadow phase).

However, this Noble Phantasm is a full-on operation that unleashes BB's abilities to their fullest. As the original heroine of horror, she strives to be like a final boss unleashing its last strike while getting a reaction like, \"Whoa, she's ginormous! Scary! We're in serious trouble!\" After turning herself into an enormously powerful giant, BB easily rips up the ground and invades that world as if it were no more difficult than scooping up a spoonful of pudding.\n\n\nApparently, the second divinity she fused with won't make its appearance here until her third Ascension...\n\n"

Also, he may be aware of this or not, but his self-esteem is somewhat stronger than when he is a Lancer.\n\n\nThe performance of his Saint Graph has increased when compared to his time as a Lancer but, on the other hand, the degree of difficulty of his summoning also went up.\n\nNo matter how excellent is the competency of the summoner, this Saint Graph will not be established unless specific conditions are met and it may even vanish like mist.\n\n",

Similar to pseudo-servants, the one with the strongest ego will be selected and manifest as an alter-ego.\nThe individual who became the vessel was not a human mage, but the latest and last homunculus created by the Einzberns. Possessing large-scale Command Spells that covered the entire body, the quality of her magecraft is first-rate, her performance as a Master was said to be top class.  She also secretly held the ability to function as a Lesser Grail. \nThe True Name registered on the Saint Graph is Sitonai. This seems to be due to the fact that out of the three Heroic (Divine) Spirits gathered in the vessel, Sitonai appears to be the most strongly apparent.\n\n",

            "Bond 2": "A girl who shows a pure smile. \n\nHowever, that smile hides a great cruelty----\nPersonality-wise, she resembles that of the homunculus who became the base. The young Heroic Spirit Sitonai of the Ainu who displays the courage to fight unfitting of her age, The goddess of love Freyja who shows sympathy to her opponents, and the witch Louhi who mercilessly slaughters her opponents... While her personality matches these aspects of the beings fused into the Alter Ego, for now it takes after the personality of 'the girl who became the vessel'.\n\n",
            "Bond 3": "Snow Fairy: EX\n\nAn evolved version of the skill Child of Nature. Once it is designated as an attack target, even loved ones can be frozen. The ability to spontaneously freeze any surrounding target.\nEmotional Freezing: B\n\nFreezing the emotions. Becoming emotionless.\nWhile she is a girl who smiles innocently, her thoughts can sometimes become like that of a cold-hearted demon, and her mental state can be wielded as a weapon. The heart of ice may sometimes become a sword, or it may sometimes become an armor.\n\n",
            "Bond 4": "Kamuy Yukar: A\n\nThe divine hymn of he who claimed himself a Kamuy.\nAs an Alter Ego, uttering the Kamuy Yukar allows her to borrow the power of various Kamuys within the Ainu lore. It is possible to use the power of even the Pase Kamuys (the superior Kamuys) related to mountains, villages, and the sea.\nCrimson gold: B++\n\nThe skill of Nordic Goddess Freyja. To Freyja, who attracted not only gods but also even hostile giants, loved only one individual. It was said that tears of crimson gold flowed out as Freyja wept thinking about him, who lives only to travel.\nHowever, this skill is not used in this work.\n\n",

Strengthened by the magical energy of the divine spirits Freyja and Louhi, it changed appearance from a hound to a bear; and its existence has become close to that of an Elemental. \nIf it's a goddess' familiar, a fierce and large appearance is rather fitting, but it won't do for it to be a phantasm or mythical beast--- as a result of Freyja accepting that claim from Louhi, two out of three agreed to turn it into a bear. \n\nA permanently active Noble Phantasm. When its True Name is invoked, consecutive attacks consisting of [a charge attack by the dog (bear)], [a bow-and-arrow attack filled with ice magic], and [a slash from Sitonai] will occur like an avalanche. Due to Sitonai's nature, it will apply a special effect against dragons.\n\n"

Using these laws as a curse-like binding force, the Noble Phantasm coerces the world itself.\n\nHowever, its scope is limited by the population of the territory he recognizes as his own so it does not fall strictly into the Anti-World category.\n\n",

Because interference from the natural world is required to preserve her body, one could also say that she is bound to a human form as a result.\nBloodsucker: C\n\nThe ability to use a fixed quantity of energy from any sort of life-form, be it plant or animal, for a destitute body.

No matter where she goes, she\u2019ll more than likely have no trouble getting used to her surroundings and getting along with those around her.

Even though it may only be a shadow, due to the burden that it places on Gray who is but a human, it is regularly sealed within Add and only released when the need arises. \nThe various weapons that Add is able to transform into is made possible from the overflowing power of Rhongomyniad.\nThough it may be sealed by the mystic code and placed under 13 restrictions, the Holy Spear continues to shine as bright as ever.\n\n",

            "Bond 2": "As a person with an extremely volatile temperament, he had furiously cut down a checkpoint guard, after being asked to dismount and state his family name, saying \u201cWhat are you trying to do making this Katsuzou (Mori Nagayoshi) dismount; how could there be such ignorance in the presence of Lord Nobunaga?\u201d, forcing his way past the checkpoint and threatening to set fire to the town if anyone tried to stop him.\nWhen he reached a bridge immediately after that, he was asked to dismount, and furiously cut down (et cetera) and there were no shortages of such anecdotes. \nBy the way, the person who gave the order to dismount and state the family name is none other than Lord Nobunaga himself.  \nBut he was somehow forgiven.\nNobunaga: \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \n\n\n\"There\u2019s no helping it, since it\u2019s Onimusashi\u201d\n\n",

There is also an erudite side to him, in his appreciation of tea and calligraphy.  What the heck is wrong with you.\nWhile possessing an affinity with the Lancer and Rider classes as well as the Berserker class, he is invariably affected by Madness Enhancement, regardless of the class he is summoned in, curiously enough. \nTo put it more clearly, it would be dangerous to even look or talk to him, and he\u2019s the sort of person with whom one should avoid eye contact, even if you met him on the streets.\n\n",

It creates difficulties in establishing mutual intelligibility with any target, including the Master, causing rampages.  With his brutality augmented, he would remain in battle until he slaughters his enemies or dies himself.\nDemon Musashi's Will: C\nThe last will and testament left by Nagayoshi.  Two separate effects are activated when the skill is activated and when he is rendered incapable of combat, respectively.

At that time, it was said that both friend and foe rejoiced, yet such a tale's veracity is questionable.\nIn any case, while Nagayoshi\u2019s life is filled with nonsensical anecdotes of gratuitous violence, he has never levelled his spear at his liege even once in his entire life.  Even now, when he is summoned as a Servant, he is single-mindedly loyal towards his recognised Master, in the same vein as his lieges, and there is absolutely no need for concern regarding betrayal. \nHowever, whether that very sense of loyalty would take form in accordance with the Master\u2019s wishes, remains to be seen\u2026.\n\n",

As the recipients of her unapproachable behavior and words, Kagetora's retainers fear her, yet that fear morphed and took form as fanatical faith.  And as a result, an even more inhuman way of life, reminiscent of gods and buddhas, has been forced upon Kagetora.\n\n\nTo that Kagetora, the brief scenes of life and death interspersed among the lethal conflicts she took part in, were the only times she felt human at all.\n\n\nAfter having lived her life so detached from the mundane, she attained her divine seat as the God of War, and was venerated accordingly.

Mashu and other such homunculi share this truth.)\n\nHaving lived through the eons, this planet will soon face its end.\n\nTo you children who have only been given mere tens of thousands of years to advance:\n\nPlease, show this dying planet one last dream -\n\nat the end of your small, brilliant childhoods.\n\n\n",

Even if only a dream of the dead, he was someone who lived in the present (now).\n\nSmall Da Vinci is much the same. She spends her days and nights busy in order to achieve all that she can. However, as she is running on a weaker engine now, she bears some dissatisfaction and uncertainty towards herself.\n\n\"Am I doing as well as the previous me?\"\n\nHer saying this is an expression of that uncertainty.\n\nAlthough she inherited all the memories of the previous Da Vinci, small Da Vinci never experienced any of those memories herself.\n\nBecause of that, she envies \"the years that my original self spent together with the staff of Chaldea\".\n\nThis also leads to a anxious desire to make memories to match up, and a sense of responsibility that \"I have to leave results that I can be proud of, even when compared to the original\".\n\n",

In turn, Paris chose Aphrodite.\n\nBut, Helen was already a wife of Menelaus, so, inevitably, Paris made away with Helen.\n\nSo the men who once fought to be Helen's husband, after Helen was taken, chose to collaborate to get her back, swearing a pledge to do so.\n\nThe earliest battle was inevitable,and Troy fell into war with the Greek Allies.\nIt was the beginning of the Trojan War, which it was referred to as later.\n\n",

An apple of misfortune. An apple that brings about discord with the power of the gods.\n\nThis apple, which was supposed to be gifted to the most beautiful goddess, caused the Trojan War. The apple itself has no destructive power, but as a result, it is a dangerous substitute that causes massive destruction to both sides.\n\nFor resistance, luck and mental tolerance are important.\nIt is basically not used in \u201cFGO\u201d.\n\n",

One would likely see in him a cold and callous machine, seemingly out of touch with a human heart. \nWhile he possesses talent as a strategist, he was a famed archer from the very beginning. However, one could not claim the world with mere mastery of the bow. He abandoned the bow for tactics and strategy, knowing the inadequacy of individual martial prowess.\nThat brash thought was shattered when he witnessed L\u00fc Bu, who takes on the world relying only on \u201cpersonal martial prowess\u201d, and subsequently followed L\u00fc Bu in his endeavours.\n\n",

As long as the people who die pointlessly remain less than half of the total, it could be said to be a properly functioning society, right.\u201d\nAs such, after becoming a Servant, his wish as a strategist takes priority somewhat, and he has high hopes for the Master as his employer.\nPlease, by all means, be a liege who once again brings life to the \u2018plans\u2019 that I myself has thought of, and had once given up.\n\n",

            "Bond 1": "Height/Weight: 166 cm, 43 kg \n\nSource: Historical fact \n\nOrigin: France \n\nAlignment: Neutral Good \n\nGender: Female \n\nThe mysterious living being(?) that accompanies her is called an \"angel\" by Charlotte, but it can't be determined if it's an angel or not. Or rather, it can't even be determined if it's a living being or not.\n\n",
            "Bond 2": "A cheerful, precocious, and active but humble girl. \n\nHer hobby is reading, and if nothing had happened she would have ended her life at a convent, and her name wouldn't have remained in history. \n\nHowever, due to the convent closing in the aftermath of the French Revolution, her fate changed.\n\n",
            "Bond 3": "The motive why she reached the conclusion of assassinating Jean-Paul Marat is quite complicated, but if it had to be said in few words, she'd say it was \"to save thousands of people\".\n\nMarat, who agitated the masses, and kept shedding blood for the revolution's sake, was seen as the ringleader of the chaotic France at the moment.\nOriginally, it was a reckless plan that shouldn't suceed. But situations of fortuity/luck/contempt sided with her, and she eventually fulfilled the assassination.\nIt was later investigated whether there were collaborators in her assassination planning, but it was concluded that there was almost no doubt that Charlotte Corday planned the assassination alone.\nShe was executed with the guillotine, and the man in charge at the moment was Charles-Henri Sanson.\n\nIn the way from the prison to the execution stage, Sanson traveled with her for about two hours, and admired her in his memoirs with \"She kept a gentle and brave attitude to the end, and didn't expose fear or anger\".\n\n",

Differing from other assassination Noble Phantasms, evasion by instinct or the eye of the mind is difficult.\n\nThe more often her looks, her words, her gestures are acknowledged, the more the success rate of the assassination rises. \n\nThe prejudice of \"such a pretty girl can't plan an assassination\" is continuously strengthened.\n\n",
            "Extra": " For her, her second life begins with disappointment and setbacks. Judging from the installed knowledge, her assassination did not change history, nor did it make the world right.\n\nTherefore, she has just been summoned, and tends to despise herself with a bit of ridicule.\n\nAs you fight with the master, you will regain your original brightness.\n\nShe was summoned by Odysseus and unconsciously spies in the Greek Revelation, but was released by the eradication of Zeus Nanomachine.\n\nShe achieved assassination of Odysseus alone. She has a faint love for the master, and although she managed to hide it, she loses her memory of concealing it just before her disappearance.\n\nWithout color, the love disappeared with the sunset.\n\n",

The water and penguin Servant.\n\nOf the 5 major casinos in Las Vegas, she is the \nowner of the Heavenly Water Palace. At the casino, slots would be considered as the main attraction. However, there's a rumor of gusts of wind blowing out of nowhere, spinning the slot machines at a wicked speed.\n\nThe whereabouts of the Heavenly Water Palace\u2019s patrons (Servants) who had been left aside on the streets without a penny to their name are unknown to this day. Speculations predict that they were trapped by Lambda and turned into experience points...\n\n",

Becoming a Lancer has ranked down this skill.\n\n\nGoddess' Essence: C\n\nA skill that reflects how she was born as the perfect goddess.\n\nDue to her core being changed from that of Saraswati to Leviathan, it has been ranked down.\n\n",
            "Bond 2": "An aquatic prima donna and a charismatic figure skater. Riding the ocean waves, she refers herself as the Queen of the Seas.\n\n\nReady to fight at a moment's notice without mercy. A queen who enjoys tormenting others as a hobby.\n\nShe loves the structural beauty of things, and will not permit anything ugly that opposes what she believes to be perfection.\n\nAs she is a perfect existence, she is able to do anything by her power which she prides herself upon.\n\nShe holds herself highly for this...... Well, that\u2019s her typical self. This time she appears as a professional figure skater who drives the audience and shows them a good time, so she\u2019s biting back on the bullying... mostly.\n\nWith that being said, her personal motto of \u201cI myself am the standard for beauty, and my beauty itself is absolute in this world\u201d hasn\u2019t really changed.\n\nNo matter how beautiful or popular the other Swimsuit Swordmasters are, gracefully she would brush them off. \u201cOh, is that so? But, I\u2019m the most beautiful, aren\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n",
            "Bond 3": "A star doesn't reveal their true self. As for her private life, she would only divulge any detail for simply one reason: it's out of her own thoughtfulness as a reward for her passionate fans.\n\nShe makes sure to emphasize that she is not Meltlilith but Mysterious Alter Ego \u039b.\n\nNormally, in front of her sisters, she doesn't flaunt her charismatic side (Is that so?).\n\nAs the personification of lambda, the feeling of being a pro is strong within this Spirit Origin. \n\n\nDue to Leviathan's influence, she is deeply envious. However, from the beginning she has always been obsessed with the idea of \"the only thing I love\". This obsession is so massive that it nears what could be considered as a black hole. In reality, the aspect of deeply-ingrained envy was present from the beginning.\n\n",
            "Bond 4": "Swan Lake: A\n\nBy holding back her sadism, Crime Ballet underwent a transformation.\n\nFrom weakened attack power and evasion, she has become a dancer who is able to captivate the audience's hearts for a longer time and with even more beauty than what was possible before the transformation. \n\n\nPerfect Fluid: B\n\nWith the Authority granted by Leviathan, she is able to turn into liquid and transform the world around her into seawater. The only way to defeat the Melt who has undergone this transformation is through the use of an attack that pierces invincibility. \n\n\nMelt Envy: EX\n\nOne of the seven deadly sins: Envy. A corrupted version of Melt Virus due to Leviathan's influence. By weakening other party Servants' mana, she is able to amplify her Noble Phantasm.\n\nAt a glance, it is a powerful skill, but at critical moments, it is a devilish skill that undermines her other party members.\n\n",
            "Bond 5": "[The Glass-like Summer Dew]\n\nRank:B+\n\nClassification: Anti Unit\n\nRange: 10~50\n\nMaximum targets: 1\n\nBlue Summer Palladion\n \n\nAccording to Leviathan, \"Summer Dew\" is read as \"Summer\" and \"Glass\" is read as \"Stars\".\n\nBinding her targets in a sphere of water, Lambda dives into a megatsunami called forth by her. With Leviathan as her escort, they speed through the waters at a high velocity, launching themselves out of the water, their bodies piercing through the water-bound targets like missiles.\n\nResurfacing, Lambda assumes the form of an elegant flying fish while also being a mythical lance with the ability to destroy cities.\n\n\n[Lament of the Seventh Deadly Sin\u2019s Tsunami]\n\nRank: EX\n\nClassification: Anti Barrier\n\nRange: 50~500\n\nMaximum Targets: 500\n\n\nLeviathan Melt Purge.\n\nAccording to Leviathan, read \"Lament of the Seventh Deadly Sin\" as \"Summer Sea Song\". Is this the work of a summer sin...?\n\nEverything that is swept away by the tsunami is gathered in one place, locked within a sphere of water, and annihilated by the Meltlilith who has assumed the form of a graceful water dragon resting at the bottom of the ocean.\n\n",
            "Extra": " As recorded in the Old Testament and the Book of Job, Leviathan is a massive monster that resides in the ocean.\n\nAfter the Last Judgement, God created massive beasts as a source of food for humanity.\n\nThey were the Behemoth who resided on the land and the Leviathan (Livyatan) who made its home in the ocean. \n\n\nTogether, the two were one. However, while Behemoth was a gentle-natured herbivore, Leviathan was a vicious beast. \n\n\nAll leviathans are recorded as being female, and later on, they are depicted as enormous snakes.\n\n\nFor humans, the ocean was an existence alongside death up until the Middle Ages. From this, Leviathan became to be thought of as a devil-like monster, and all of a sudden, Leviathan came to be the symbol for the seventh Deadly Sin: Envy.\n\nIn satanism, Leviathan is subordinate to Beelzebub and holds power and authority in Hell. Besides that, Leviathan is also the grand admiral of the navies of Hell. On the other hand, in the Book of Job, Leviathan is just a large creature that swims around in the ocean, making whirlpools and bringing forth waves. \n\n\n\"As long as we have Divinity and we're girls, that makes us goddesses right??? \u2606\"\n\n\nBB-chan's simple interpretation explodes forth.\n\n",

Poor Okita-san died... (Actually she's not dead).\n\n\nOh shoot!? Not only I made contact with the native population, but also killed her... It's going to affect my bonus' assessment!! was what XX-san was convinced thus got panicked, she used the leftover parts she had on-hand to sloppily put together a life-support system (Jetpack), and as a result of it being equipped on her, a mysterious Shinsengumi woman was born. Actually she just lost consciousness, and with XX-san's mistake, she became a futuristic Shinsengumi Soldier who is incorporated with the Universe's mysterious technologies.\n\n\nThanks to the life-support system, the limit on her Weak Constitution skill was also removed, in addition, she also obtained a theoretically over 800 years of operation and an overly healthy body, however due to some misunderstandings, Okita-san thought she only had 3 days left to live.\n\n\nThis form that can freely soar through the blue sky, to the girl who was engulfed in the warm light under the edge of the eaves and fleetingly faded away in the waves of time, perhaps can be said to be an irreplaceable long summer dream.\n\n\nOf course, since the disturbance to space-time caused by XX-san only has enough magical energy for the summer, so once summer ends, everything would turn back to how it once was.

Or as having the most suitable disposition of a consort to the greatest being in existence\u2026?\n\u201cDoes she actually pay any attention to what's going on?\u201d the other goddesses and consorts would say.\nHowever, even if such things were to enter her ears, she would just continue smiling away.\n\n",

A love surpassing what was held between this brother and sister was never to be seen again. Out of wanting to forever remember the close relationship the two held, Zeus created a constellation using the stars of two independent formations, thus naming the constellation Gemini.\n\n\n",

Throughout the ages it was said they were the savior of those who were confronted with adversity in battle and on the seas.\n\nHolding various names over time such as \u201cThe Two Pillars\u201d and others, the Dioscuri actually did not have any name in particular that stuck until the age of the bard Homer came around where the names Castor and Polydeuces (Pollux) were solidified due to the collection of Homeric Hymns that was created.\n\n\nWhile at one time holding the title of \u300cRuler (Anactes)\u300d, as the ages passed they came to be more known as the Patrons of Sailors, leaning on the effect of their existence within stories like the \u201cArgonautica\u201d becoming strongly ingrained in history. It has been believed over the ages that the light (St Elmo\u2019s Fire) which appears upon the top of a ship\u2019s mast within a raging storm to guide weary travelers is a manifestation of the twins themselves.\n\n",
            "Bond 3": "Being at their core an ancient Divine Spirit they manifested with special traits at the time of their summoning. They exist as one while residing in two separate physical bodies in which can be found the traits of different classes.  As for the explanation\u2026\n\nThe humiliation the older brother Castor, who became the child of a mortal without the blood of Zeus in later legends, felt falling from the world of gods to the human's world turned into hatred, resulting in his manifestation as an Avenger.\n\nLiving a life with a body that cannot be hurt and doing battle with fierce swordsmanship, the immortal one who bears the bloodline of Zeus, Pollux has appeared as a Saber.\n\nRecorded in their Spirit Origin is that of the Saber class, however, to be more accurate the two of them are what is considered a double class servant.

Pollux also began to hold hatred against humanity due to what humanity had made her brother go through.\n\nAs a result of this, the brother and sister began to possess flames of hatred in their hearts and while interacting with the citizens of Olympus and Chaldea they were ever so violent and vicious.\n\n\u25c6\nOn the other hand, their Pan-Human History selves that were summoned to Chaldea, do not hold as much hatred as their Lostbelt counterparts. Castor\u2019s Spirit Origin was formed as that of the Avenger class due to his background and mental state. However, Pollux has become quite more pleasant in comparison to her Lostbelt self. The sister will make sure to put him in his place when he\u2019s out of line, so to a certain extent it\u2019s okay to not worry too much about his attitude.\n\n\n"

Though once a woman, Caenis later became a man\u2026. it has been said.\n\n\nIn the past Caenis was beyond a doubt a true woman, beauty renowned, and praised as one of the most beautiful maidens in Thessaly. At one point after turning down numerous courters, Caenis received the love of the sea god Poseidon (Neptune) and also lost the chastity once held. Satisfied, the sea god said, \"I will grant all of your wishes\" to which Caenis replied, \"Please make me no longer a woman so that I will never have to go through an experience like this ever again\" and Caenis became an invincible man, the legend says.\n\n\nIt cannot be said for sure that Caenis actually became a man due to some tales left behind. After death in one story, Caenis is said to have become a bird with golden wings and disappeared into the skies, but there is also another tale that the corpse of a woman was left behind. Either way, the subsequent Caenis/Caeneus became a mighty warrior and showed the world a powerful tyrant that could rule the lands.\n\n",

            "Bond 2": "A warrior who held hatred within themselves.\n\nWhat Caenis hates is the ocean. \n\nWhat Caenis hates is God. \n\nThough holding enough anger to have aptitude as an Avenger, Caenis usually does not feel anger in such a way. \n\nWhen in a good mood, you can see a bright smile on Caenis' face and even if Caenis is not in a good mood, if you try to start a conversation, you'll get an answer while going along with any sort of idle banter. \n\nHaving a sweet tooth, Caenis would definitely be beyond pleased if the subject were to come up!\n\n\nHowever, once the anger found within has been set ablaze, it is beyond uncontrollable. \n\nEven becoming willing to kill Master, and at times entering a frenzy that rivals that of a Berserker.\n\n",

In Caenis\u2019 current appearance that same tale has intertwined into a Noble Phantasm, however, there is a chance of the special trait of being able to change appearance at will going out of control. This tale may be the source of why Caenis\u2019 appeared in a female\u2019s body and also why Caenis\u2019 body has animal characteristics.\n\n\nAs Caenis\u2019 ascension progresses further and further, the Noble Phantasm (shown as a skill in this story) which consists of Poseidon\u2019s protection and blessing becomes more and more present. From this Caenis becomes closer and closer to regaining the form held when once alive. In other words an unparalleled existence with a magnificent suit of armor like that of Poseidon's.\n\n\nFurthermore, Caenis\u2019 spirit origin was formed with a massive increase in power resulting from Poseidon\u2019s favor. Already at a point beyond what is a Heroic Spirit, Caenis has appeared as a Divine Spirit before us.\n\n",

The manifestation before us is the figure of the young Romulus who founded Roma and later came to be deified as Quirinus who was a part of the triad of supreme Roman gods.\n\n\nAs an existence that was deified, the manifestation heavily symbolizes the history of expansion and growth of civilization during Ancient Roma and the vicious, violent events it entailed.

Normally, it is unthinkable that a Divine Spirit would be summoned as a Grand Class servant. However, due to the deep relationship Romulus holds with human history and his becoming a supreme god while living as a human, he who is an exception above exceptions has brought an innumerable amount of miracles together to be summoned as a Grand Class Lancer in the Fifth Lostbelt.\n\n\nWithin the Fifth Lostbelt, numerous servants who sided with humanity stood up to the Lostbelt King Zeus, but all lost in battle. These servants gathered the last vestiges of their power into one final grand plan, and entrusted their hope to Chaldea. That final grand plan was called \u201cOperation: God Slayer\u201d. Simultaneously holding onto his human self and his existence as a peak god within the entirety of mythological records, he stood on the side of humanity. Capable of wielding power in the same realm as the almighty and all knowing Zeus of Greek Mythology, Romulus-Quirinus would be summoned as a part of \u201cOperation: God Slayer\u201d.\n\n\nFollowing this the team from Chaldea made their appearance and \u201cOperation: God Slayer\u201d finally took form. Romulus-Quirinus manifested and from there did battle together with Chaldea and brought down the Machine Gods of the Lostbelt. \n\n\nAnd he then disappeared along with the God Slayer.\n\nThought to never be able to fully manifest ever again\u2026\n\nHowever, thanks to the relationship fostered with the master and being recorded within Novum Chaldea\u2019s Trismegistus, it became possible for his Spirit Origin to be summoned as a non-Grand Class servant. Once again he wields his spear of light for humanity.\n\n"

To adapt to the worsening effects of the possession she named it \u201cDemon King (Erlk\u00f6nig)\u201d allowing her to control it at will.  Furthermore, though she may be able to sense the death and bloodthirst at a superhuman level, the evil spirits within are in a constant state of hunger for sacrifices and if that hunger is not satisfied they will consume Erice\u2019s body.\n\n",

Through this she uses her vast knowledge coldy dealing with Heroic Spirits as the Grim Reaper, and at the same time holding deep respect towards the life they once led. \n\nWhile she may cooly say \u201cNot really\u2026. In Mosaic City that type of stuff was just normal everyday life\u2026\u201d, while at Chaldea she supposedly secretly passes everyday away getting so excited that the blood rushes all the way to her head almost leading to nose bleeds.\n\n",
