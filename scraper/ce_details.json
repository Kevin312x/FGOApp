A man without a face, also has no eyes to see. He cannot obtain anything. Fan Translation: He is, after all, the bad guy. He\u2019s no different than a bandit.It\u2019s not a profession where he can show his face to people -A hood and mud are what suits him. If he could devote himself to hiding his form as a human being, everything would go smoothly.He wouldn\u2019t be hated, he wouldn\u2019t be targeted.If someone can\u2019t be trusted, then they can\u2019t be loved. At the time, he thought that way of life was easy,Being ostracized as a human being.Didn\u2019t he obtain many things?Unfortunately, he was a phantom.A man with no face has no eyes to see things.Even if something were to pass into those hands, there would be nothing to hold them.

It is truly a masterpiece, and the only thing that was allowed in his heart, the heart of a man who claimed he needed no friend and no comrade. Slash, thrust, strike, sweep, repel. The weapon utilizes all the qualities that you can find in a two-handed weapon, an almighty and all-purpose weapon, if I may say so myself. Many people may say, well isn't that because the General wasn't skilled enough to switch weapons depending on the ever-changing battlefield? I say to those people, you are just jealous of the General's talent in martial arts. The simple truth is, if he has the time to switch weapons, he might as well use that time to destroy more enemies. Isn't that a form of courage that's worthy of his nickname the Flying General? Well, this weapon actually originated from the Northern Song Dynasty, and it shouldn't exist in a time where Lu Bu was alive. Then why is he holding that weapon you ask? That's because I went ahead before it's time and secretly developed the weapon. Fan Translation: Then, despite being late, I will explain! Fangtian Huaji is the symbol of the general who had none but his halberd with him under heaven. Neither friends nor anyone else was needed - the general needs only himself, and his masterful weapon as support. Behead, thrust, strike, mow down, sweep away. With all the features this large two-handed weapon had, One could say it was an all purpose weapon. The general must be unskilled to not simply change his weapon according to the battle, Isn't he? Someone with a shrewd viewpoint and jealous of the general\u2019s prowess would say something like that. The truth is, the reason it\u2019s an all-purpose weapon is simply because The time it takes to switch weapons could be used to route ten more enemies. Surely befitting of the title Flying General, isn\u2019t he. Well, in actuality that weapon is from the Northern Song Dynasty, Meaning it did not exist when Lu Bu was alive. There it is - I secretly Developed it ahead of its time. [1]",

It was one of a poor old man who couldn't prepare a gift, whose social status would not allow him to attend the feast... It was a gift made from the bottom of the beggar's heart. It's true that admiration, and many desires are what make life interesting. But it is that one sincere deed that no one notices, which brings happiness to life. Fan Translation: The king once invited a man who had reached enlightenment to a lavish party. It continued into the night, and the man\u2019s path home slipped into darkness. The king, rich as he was, decorated this path with lamps, but with one strong gust of wind, the lights he had prepared all went out. Despite this, one faint light still illuminated the enlightened man\u2019s way. It was the heartfelt gift of a poor old man, who could not afford even one offering, and whose low social status prevented him from admission to the party. \u2014Receiving much praise and admiration certainly can add flavor to life. But I consider myself blessed to have known this one quiet act of devotion.",

I howl at, pierce, shatter everything. Full of desire but no love, I devour and consume. \u25c6 Oh, Nero... Beloved child of my younger sister, Agrippina, and the spitting image of her. I don't care if it is but modest. I want you alone to be happy. Be awash in light and love. I will take away the darkness and evil, the lunacy and rage. Therefore, may your path be filled with blessed roses. Fan Translation: Everything can be found in Rome.The empire created by our great founding king, is no doubt a great step forward for mankind.Prosper, flourish, and be fruitful.Such precious brilliance is something befitting Rome. But at the same time---Terrifying and fearful negative thoughts, and things that can certainly be called evil.These have also been gathered in Rome. Then, what is the true reason for my fall into madness?Did I desire violence, fresh blood, and treachery by myself?No. That is not so.  The goddess of the moon saved me by granting me madness.For me, who was swallowed up by the vortex of countless conspiracies in the darkness of the empire, the goddess granted a reversal of my pathetic state. ...Thus, I went mad, I became angry.I howled fiercely at everything. I pierced. I crushed.I ate, I spent, I loved and indulged in all my desires. Ah, Nero---The beloved child and spitting image of my sister Agrippina.Even if it is just a little bit, as long as you are happy that is enough.Bathe only in light and love. I will carry away darkness and evil along with my madness and rage.That is why, I pray, may your path be filled with blessed roses.",

Why am I helping you? The answer I will put down here for you, the one I love.  While we share a common past, you aren't like me.  While God have made you suffer and you have cursed Him, you do not reject Him.  I have seen the truth of faith there.  While sinking into a sea of evil, I have honest respect for you not having drowned in it.  I will help you till the end of your days.  ... Welcome, to the dining hall of nightmares and terror.\" Fan Translation: \"Ah, Gilles, Gilles! My dear friend!When I think of you still suffering in your bitter hell, my fragile reason just shatters into pieces!Your suffering is my suffering.Your pleasure is my pleasure.And the crimes that you committed, are of course the crimes that I committed!While loving people, you hate them. While hating them, you put them on trial. Such a contradiction, such a cry of the soul, is something I care about more than anything else, and something I desire to save.And then. It's too bad, but there is no way to escape from that immorality.Because it is something to be overcome, not something to be treated.Further research and further study will be helpful.That is what you asked me in the past, no?Why did I help you? The answer to that, will be the words I leave for you here, my darling.We have a common past, but we are not the same.While seeing God poorly, while blaspheming God, even after becoming something like this, you did not deny God.I saw true faith in you.I respect you, who sank into the sea of evil without drowning in it. I am someone who will support your path to the very end. ---Welcome, to the banquet hall of nightmares and terror.\"",

He's a noble and honest man, and although stubborn, from the amount of time I've spent with him I know the delicateness of his heart, his strength, and his sternness more than anyone. I am Gringolet, the fairy steed. Today again, I conquer the plains with Sir Galatine. No, that's wrong again. It's Sir Galain. Fan Translation: I am called the fae horse, Gringolet. A gorilla rides upon my back. No, that\u2019s not it. He is not a gorilla. He is Sir Galatine. His silver armor may be heavy, but when it comes to the man, He is a refreshing pretty boy Whose body is also heavy, due to his un-pretty-boy-like muscle distribution. But, his excellent disposition is brilliant, As though he were a downpour, but of sunshine, Which I suppose could be sweltering, making him a hot-blooded man, Who usually rides around a thousand miles in a day. And if a fight breaks out, without stopping, he annihilates his opponents with his hands, Staying up for three days and three nights straight, as is natural for him. Although he seems obtusely straightforward, Sir Unfaltering, He has a modest heart, is strong, And someone who understands better than anyone the severity of load weight. I am the fae horse, Gringolet. Today again too, I shall conquer the moors with Sir Galatine. No, that\u2019s wrong again. He is Sir Ga ain.",

The arm was a god-forged armor created by Dian Cecht, the god of medicine, blacksmithing, and craftsmanship. Of course, this was created as a replacement for Bedivere's lost right arm, and is not Nuadha's arm. It is a temporary Noble Phantasm, made stronger by giving it the name of an item from legend. Its true identity is \u2013 the sacred sword that he was never able to return. In Chapter 6, the sacred sword was returned. Thus, as a special exception, the right arm that he bears when he sits in the Throne of Heroes is not the sacred sword itself. A virtual sacred sword.

Of course, this is not Nuada's arm.  By giving the name of this arm a similar one to the legends, they could back up the existence of this arm. It is a temporary Noble Phantasm. The true identity of this -- is the Holy Sword which was not returned. In Chapter 6, the Holy Sword was safely returned to the Lake.  Because of that, when he arrived in the Throne of Heroes, aspecial case was made. That which resides in his right arm is the Holy Sword no more. An imaginary construction of the Holy Sword. It is no longer a Noble Phantasm that ate into the soul.The bond that which binds a servant and his Master will allow it to be activated. In that sense, it is a new Noble Phantasm.",

This is not the truth only of life, but also true of the world itself. The world is constantly experiencing destruction and creation. The Aztec gods will always create a new world after they destroy the old one. The current world was also born through this process as the fifth world. And at the center of this world (or perhaps, it is the world itself) is what allows and protects life to flourish: the sun. Quetzalcoatl is said to be the sun of the second world, and guided the fifth sun. The Aztecs saw the world in the sun. They saw destruction, creation, death, and birth. There are five suns (worlds) carved into the Sun Stone, an artifact which was once kept in the temple at Tenochtitlan, and is now kept in Mexico City. Someday the fifth world will disappear too. When that happens, will a new, sixth world be born? Or perhaps... \"That's up to you guys, yes!\" Fan Translation: Regarding death in Central American mythology, although it marks the end of growth and maturity, it is also the harbinger of new life. It is definitely not just a way of life for living things. It is a way of life for the world. The world, itself, constantly repeats the cycle of creation and destruction. The Aztec gods always create the next world after destroying the old one. The current world we live in is said to be the fifth one to have been born through such a process. And, the sun is that which protects the prosperity of life as the center of the world, or in other words as the world itself. According to one theory, Quetzalcoatl is the sun of the second world, and the guide for the sun of the fifth world. The Aztecs saw the sun as the world. In it they saw destruction and creation, death and rebirth. The \"Sun Stone\" that was once kept in the Temple of Tenochtitlan, and now in modern day Mexico City, is inscribed with all five worlds. With everything, in the past and present. The fifth sun will one day disappear. At that time, will the sixth world be born, or... \"---That, is up to you!\"",

Its Sumerian name was Imdugud. It was a demon of storms, and a god who was a manifestation of strong winds and great clouds. This monstrous bird served Enlil, but one day, it stole a great treasure while its master was bathing. And when it did, all creation was shrouded in darkness, and the world was threatened with destruction. The great treasure that Anz\u00fb stole was the Tablet of Destinies, the ultimate symbol of royal authority over the world and its gods. And so, a creature like Anz\u00fb should never have been allowed to touch it. Not because it threatened the world with destruction, no, but because the royal authority would not answer to a being that did not have any right to it. And so the hero god Ninurta, son of Enlil, stole back the Tablet and the world was restored. And many years later, when the age of man was at its peak, the great treasure was brought to the golden city. What would the raging storm god Anz\u00fb think? What would one who could not seize royal authority think when the King of Heroes, a descendant of the gods, managed what it couldn't? Fan Translation: A long, long time ago.In the time of the ancient gods.The King of the Gods was not Marduk (Merodach), but Enlil. There was a certain monstrous bird. The Akkadians called it Anzu, the Sumerians called it Imdugud.It was a demon of storms, a god that brought great clouds and strong winds.Though this monster was a servant of the god Enlil, one day, it stole a precious treasure while its master was in the bath.Then, all was engulfed in darkness, and the world was close to ruin. The treasure that Anzu hid away was the ultimate authority that ruled over the world and the gods--- the Tablet of Destiny.Indeed, the monstrous bird should not have touched it.Was it because it would have brought crisis to the world? No.As the royal authority would not respond to the undeserving, Anzu gained nothing from it. In truth, the precious treasure was reclaimed by Enlil's son, the Hero-God Ninurta, and the world restored. And after a long time had passed, when the age of man dawned.This great treasure would be kept in the city of gold.What did the god of storms, Anzu, think?That the usurpation of the royal authority which he failed, was accomplished by a human in which the blood of gods flowed, the Hero-King---",

It's said that generations later, Iskandar, the Conquering King, would add an image of the Gorgon's head as an emblem to his own portrait. The monster's corpse granted unmatched power, and was used as a symbol for generations to come. But what of the two Mystics that were born from the blood of the wound inflicted by the hero Perseus? The Pegasus. The Chrysaor. Were they gifts from the god of the sea, as the legend says? Or perhaps... Were they the last remnants of emotion of a monster that did not want others making use of its corpse? Fan Translation: The monster was killed by a hero.

Under the guise of an accolade, she spent her later days in a splendid palace. Decadence and love filled the palace walls. The country had set itself on the correct path. Feeling safe, she indulged herself in her desires. It was probably the first reward that was given to her, as she had endlessly and tirelessly worked so very hard. But...the people who surrounded her...the people to whom she had offered so much love...were not all righteous. A coup d'\u00e9tat occurred. Those she loved were killed, and she was expelled from the palace. She realized...in astonishment... There was a possibility...that the righteousness that she envisioned and the righteousness that the populace desired were different. When...did that divide happen? Or was it...right from the beginning? Fan Translation: She attempted a great undertaking. A righteous country, and a righteous rule. Those who perform great deeds must receive their rightful reward. In accordance with that doctrine, in her later years, she spent her days in gorgeous and opulent palaces, filled with decadence and love.  The country was already on the right track. She could indulge her desires without worry. That may have been the first reward ever given for her ceaseless hard work. But--- those who orbited the righteous woman, those that she lavished her love upon; not all of them were righteous themselves. When a coup d'etat occurred, her loved ones were killed, and she was exiled from the palace, she noticed it, in amazement. What she thought was righteous, and what the masses thought were righteous. There was a possibility that their thoughts may have strayed apart. From when... did this happen? Or could it be, right from the beginning---",

And at that time, Pinzon, captain of the Pinta, sailed off somewhere without permission.

        "Dialogue": "The Universe Rings, like the Red Armillary Sash, are one of the famed Baobei of Jinguangdong. It was a Taoist weapon that was presented by Taiyi Zhenren to celebrate Nezha's birth. Since then, Nezha always carried it with her. The weapon can expand and contract at will. They are usually worn around the wrist as a pair of bracelets, but they quickly turn into a pair of circular blades the moment they leave the body. Nezha uses this weapon like a semi-autonomous drone. When she throws them up in the air and shouts \"J\u00ed (speed)!\" the Rings shoot towards the enemy. When she shouts \"T\u00edng (stay)!\" they stop in mid-air, and they return to her hand when she shouts \"L\u00e1i (come)!\" But there was a time when Nezha didn't carry the Universe Rings. They were taken from her in the battle against Lady Rock, and later retrieved by Taiyi Zhenren, who kept them temporarily. From the time of Nezha's suicide to save her human parents and atone for her sins until her rebirth, they were out of her possession. To Nezha, this Baobei is closely associated with humiliating and regrettable memories. Therefore, she would never entrust the Universe Rings to another unless she trusted them absolutely. If there was someone whom Nezha trusted enough to give one of the Rings, it would mean that she considered that person so close as to be a part of herself. And it would also represent a vow that she will always resurrect and come back to the holder, no matter what. Fan Translation: The Universe Ring(Kenkon Ken) together with the Red Armillary Sash(Konten Ryou) are the famous magical items of Jinguang Dong(eng. Golden Light Cave). They are the immortal weapons gifted to Nezha at her birth by Taiyi\u30fbZhenren. Since then, they have never been separated from Nezha.  It is telescopic, usually worn as a pair of bracelets on both hands, and will transform into a circular ringed object with a sharp blade when separating from her body. Nezha is known to use it like a semi-autonomous drone. By shouting \"Shi! (eng. Dash)\" when thrown into the air, it immediately attacks the enemy, \u201cTing!(eng. Stop)\u201d to stay still in the midair, and \u201cLai!( eng. Come)\u201d to return it to the hand. ---There was once when Nezha lost the possession of Universe Ring. It was taken away by Lady Shiji during their battle, but eventually returned by Taiyi\u30fbZhenren. In order to save her parents of the human world, she commits suicide to atone for the crime she has committed. Letting go of the past as a new life reborn. The absence of this magical item is linked to the memories of humiliation and her own faults. Therefore, the Universe Ring will only be entrusted to those who have absolute trust on it. Because the Universe Ring will rely upon its partner, and will sense the emotion of its partner as if they are one entity, it is a proof that it vows to resurrect and return regardless of anything.",

        "Dialogue": "This \"key\" supposedly existed in Salem, Massachusetts for a time. It was there for a few decades, but considering the key's existence is measured in centuries, that time span is just a blink of an eye. The key was methodically preserved by a thaumaturgist, who came from England. It was wrapped in parchment and then placed inside a box made out of fragrant wood that emitted a sweet-smelling aroma. The key granted special powers to the possessor. But it couldn't be in the hands of just anybody. There were specific conditions that had to be met. The conditions were that the individual had to be innocent, possess the heart of a child, and have knowledge of magecraft. This was because the key was connected to the dream world. This was due to the fact that, according to the \"Book of Eibon,\" \"Necronomicon,\" and other grimoires, the key was created by a thaumaturgist who came from the northern continent that had sunk during the Glacial Period. While it is indeed called a key since it closely resembled the excavated artifacts from the ruins of Rome, there was no lock that was paired with it. It was essentially a key based off of a concept, and it should have actually been called something similar to a staff that thaumaturgists wield. When the catastrophe that was the Witch Trials of Salem occurred, the key should have been lost and hidden away as just another myth or superstition. However, it found an individual who met the conditions to inherit it. The girl's name was Abigail Williams. The girl rightfully and correctly used the key, handed to her by the Demon God Pillar, during sunset, when the hills of the execution site turned crimson the moment the celestial bodies aligned. I\u00e4! I\u00e4! The red seal on the devil's tome inscribed by the women suspected to be witches... The same knots of the same number of nine seals were handled with the same motion fit for each seal...and the girl opened up the door that led to the \"Boundary.\" I\u00e4! I\u00e4! Y-grah'n li'gai gai! Those who gaze back on us from within the abyss of falsity. O lord of the ultimate gate who reigns beyond the corridors of dreams. O, All-in-One and One-in-All being. We must caution those who come in contact with the young girl. The girl's existence shall put the world into uncertainty. But... Oh... Ohhh...  ...The excerpt ends there. Fan Translation: \"It is said that this \"key\" did exist, for a time, in the town of Salem, Massachusetts \u2013 in fact for several decades, although of course such a span of time is but a blink of an eye when compared to the eternal aeons to which it has borne witness. It was kept under the scrupulous charge of a so-called \"magus\" of English heritage, who wrapped it in a large sheet of parchment and stowed it away inside a box of fragrant-smelling wood. The key grants the one who bears it incredible power. It will not accept just anyone. There is a clear condition attached to its use. That condition is that the bearer must be an individual of great purity, who is accomplished in magic, but still retains the innocence of youth. This is because the key opens the door to the world of dreams. By perusing such grimoires as the Book of Eibon and the Necronomicon, one may surmise that it is the craftsmanship of the magi of a northern continent, which sank beneath the waves during the intense cold of the ice age in the fearful times of old. While its appearance, recalling artifacts excavated from ancient Roman ruins, has led to its being dubbed a \"key\", this moniker should not be assumed to imply the existence of a corresponding lock. It is a key primarily in concept, and in practice it is likely much more akin to a staff, of the variety that a magus might wield. When the lethal hysteria of the witch trials descended upon Salem, the key should by all rights have been obscured by a veil of falsehood and superstition and once again been lost, and it was saved from this fate only by the appearance of a suitable inheritor. The name of this girl was Abigail Williams --- At the hour of sunset, when the hill of the gallows was dyed rose-red beneath the stars, she took the key granted to her by the demon pillar in hand and turned it to its rightful purpose. I\u00e4! I\u00e4! The Red Signs, inscribed by the witch-branded within the Devil's tome! Seven twists and seven signs, and lo, with the proper motions she wound each one in turn \u2013 and so cast open the door to the Beyond! I\u00e4, i\u00e4! Y'grah'n, y'gnaiih, kn'ee! Thou who gazes back upon us from the abyss of fable! Thou who reigns beyond the corridors of dreams, the Lord of the Ultimate Gate! Thou who art all yet one and one yet all! All who would touch her must be warned \u2013 for her existence makes of the world itself a passing dream! But ah, ahh- - Note abruptly ends here.\"",

As Hokusai passed away in the same year at the age of ninety, this painting is often considered one of the Hokusai's very last. After he completed the \"Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji\" at age seventy, his passion for art didn't fade as he continued to create. He went so far as to dismiss his creations before the \"Thirty-Six Views\" as worthless doodles. It is said he started to grasp the essence of all animal's skeletal structures and the secret of life for all plants at the age of 73. By eighty, he had furthered his understanding of all things in nature. By ninety, he had reached enlightenment. Had he lived to one hundred years old, his skill might have reached the realm of the divine. By one hundred and ten, he could have made his paintings come alive. Artists of his time understood the rising dragon over Mt. Fuji to be an auspicious sign, one that signifies a person's rise to success. However, one can also see Hokusai's endless conviction in this painting. Even as he sensed his own end, he did not give in to despair and continued his endless pursuit of artistic heights none before him had ever attained. Fan Translation: \"If only Heaven will give me just another five more years, then I could have become a real artisan.\" ~Katsushika Hokusai's last words~ \"The Dragon of Smoke Escaping from Mount Fuji\" is considered to be Hokusai's last painting, who died in 1849.  Hokusai, who completed the \"Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji\" at the age of over 70 years old, continued to passionately draw art. It was even said that any art prior to this, he considered negligible and counted for nothing. At the age of 73, he understood the structure of plants and animals, improved upon them at age 80, and mastered them at age 90; at age 100, he would go beyond the level of the gods. And some decades after that, he could have drawn a single dot, a single line as if it were alive---. The dragon that climbs beyond Mount Fuji and to the heavens is seen as an auspicious symbol of success, but it can also be seen as a symbol of Hokusai's unrelenting determination. Even after realizing his own lifespan, he never accepted it; Hokusai's will to reach the heights where no man ever stood is felt here.",

Fan Translation: A return gift from Christopher Columbus.Systematically arranged boiled eggs.Not a single one of them had its bottom smashed in.All that was required was to 'Never give up'. Everyone who meets him, you included will end up asking him the question at least once. \"Did that allegory with the eggs really happen?\"they'll ask. While he'd normally make a fed-up face before laughing it off, to return the favor for the chocolate, he made a special show of denying it in a more tangible form. What's important is not the egg. it is his conviction imbued in this spectacle. Proof that the truth he believed in definitely exists. No matter how long it takes, how many times you fail, as long as you keep at it without giving in, then someday- surely- your dreams will come true.",

What I want to discuss is my magecraft workshop.They...they took it over! Auntie and Medea Lily! They said they were going to convert it into akitchen so they could make confections! And they were going to call it the Witches' Kitchen,and it will only be open on Valentine's Day! What a nuisance. Besides, calling it the Witches'Kitchen is a bad idea. It's like blatantly admittingthat the food has special properties and ingredients!

It's like just like how one must have the properfeathers if one wishes to fly!\" ...She was quite enthusiastic about it. Just the fact that she's spending time makingsweets is taking away from her being a witch... Doesn't she realize that she's just an amateurp\u00e2tissier at this point?

Never mind Lily, but Auntie... She may not seem it, but she actually looks good nomatter what she wears. So I may have gone a bit overboard, workingfeverishly at my sewing machine. But Auntie was a bit judgemental. She said that shenever knew I had such homely talents! Ugh! At any rate, I'm quite proud of how cute the littlechef coats turned out. I can't speak to the quality ofthe pastries, but I want you to at least pay attentionto how wonderful their outfits are. Since it seems I have no choice, I suppose I will letmy workshop go for now and just crash in someSaber's room. That's why I'm here, Master. I have a few questions.Auntie's been barging into my room, day and night,asking me so many things. Here are some of the things one of mythology'sgreatest witches has been asking of me: \"I want to know what Master's favorite flavor is. Doyou think they like it really sweet? Or would bitterbe better\" \"Are there any seasonings Master doesn't like? Youknow, so I can balance things properly in thefuture..\" \"Now that I think about it, handmade confectionsare so lame. What do you think, Medea?\" \"If Master was a pig in their past life, what breed doyou think they'd have been? I hear there's a hybridbrand of pigs called Tokyo \u25cf from Japan. Soundsromantic, huh? It has \u25cf in its name!\" Who cares about breeds... \"Hey Medea... I hear that Master is really traumatizedby Valentine's Day. Even if they eat our chocolateswith a smile while we watch, I hear there's vomitingback in Master's room... Sounds like a joke, doesn'tit? Huh?\" ...So, there you have it. Phew. Anyway, it looks like Auntie's a bit occupied rightnow and she can't come over, so she sent me hereon her behalf. Really, Lily should be doing this, notme. Honestly, Auntie is so fickle she gives me a headache. Teehee. Don't you agree, Master? But it does look like, in spite of herself, she's doingher best, so would you be so kind as to answer thequestions I asked? Oh, it's fine. YOu don't need to be so formal andthank me...eh?

The shop owners are an aging man and his wife. And three cats. A few years back, a young couple related to the aging shop owners traveled to this land. In the beginning, there were many problems. There were even fights. But the young couple worked hard and earnestly. Their disappointments eventually gave way to hope and security. Lunar New Year is coming once again. The shop gets quite busy, making traditional confectionary that is essential to every Chinese person living abroad. And it was then that a certain order came in. \"Q\u00edngr\u00e9nji\u00e9. Qi\u01ceok\u00e8l\u00ec.\" Valentine's Day. Chocolate. It appears the order is for a crafted confectionary for Valentine's Day. In the past, the shop owners made their famous confections and delivered them to large shops, but their weakened eyesight forced them to stop. They wanted to refuse the order, but it came from an old friend. But requesting a lotus flower confectionary for Valentine's Day is an odd choice, they thought. Every morning, the shop owners visit the town shrine. While praying, they recalled the discussion with the young couple. They are with child, and they want the aging couple to think of a name for their unborn child. A lotus flower is a symbol of children and a prayer for safe childbirth. After some thought, the shop owners decide to accept the order.

The store was set up by man and woman, married for many a year. As well as three cats. They spent a few years relying on friends before that young couple could make it from the country. They experienced great blunders at first. There were times they fought. Even so, the young man and woman held a serious work ethic. Their dried-out disappointment eventually shifts to warm hope and relief. This year, the New Year draws close once again. In making traditional sweets worthy the celebrations of the ethnic Chinese, the store is busy beyond end. During that time, the order was aimlessly dropped in. \u60c5\u4eba\u7bc0\u3001\u529f\u514b\u529b, Q\u00edngr\u00e9n ji\u00e9 Qi\u01ceok\u00e8l\u00ec. It did seem to be a request for sculpted Valentines Day chocolate. They had once sold their skills, their works being sold at a large store, but lately their eyesight was declining and they were growing distant from the trade. They wanted to decline, but the requestor was an old friend, and a troublesome one at that. Perhaps a lotus would be a rare find on Valentines day,  the thought suddenly struck him.

Her completely serious, even deadpan response was, \"Are you tired of it?\" I was about to say that I was actually getting sick of it, but when she started to look sad, I said, \"Not really,\" without thinking. Crap. \"At the edge of distant time, the gods, demons, and human prayers all intertwined to create this fragment of light.

Anyone who made fun of me before now cowered in fear and opened up the road for me whenever I passed by. That felt good. My sky was nice and clear. But eventually, the same folks started to look at me as if I were a dog. They talked about the state of the nation and other complicated stuff to keep me out of the loop. I didn't like that one bit. My sky was nice and clear, but it had started to cloud. Eventually I was wandering around the capital all alone. I had no money and I was hungry. Even though my sky was still clear, I didn't want to do anything. I didn't care anymore. I don't know how and why things ended up like this. I don't know where I made any mistakes. I'm not so smart, so I must've messed up somewhere. No, I must not have made any mistakes from the start. I know I wasn't wrong when I was playing by the riverbed with my mates back in the day. It's a splendid sky...a sky so perfectly clear. Fan Translation: My sword\u2019s got ta be best under the sun, they would chide me.

They praised me as a master worthy of heaven's wrath, they gave me plenty \u2018a money, and I felt rather swell. The folks who mocked me now feared me, they got ta walkin' on the side of the road. Truly swell indeed, It was clear skies all around. But sooner or later, they started to look at me with the eyes one looks at a dog. They started goin' on about the high affairs of the state, or some complicated stuff, and I was feelin' all left out. Couldn\u2019t stand it, with the skies so clear, I couldn\u2019t stand it. Sooner or later, I got ta loiterin\u2019 the capital city on my lonesome self. Had no money, my stomach empty as can be. The sky above me so clear, but it felt like such a pain ta move. Don\u2019t matter what happens, do it? Don\u2019t really know what happened when. Don\u2019t know when or where I went wrong. My head\u2019s never been great, so I must\u2019a gone wrong somewhere.

As I was thinking about all that, the face of that silly human flashed across my mind and it suddenly became rather unforgettable to me. I then realized that I had forgotten to devour him, and so I decided I would pursue him. This is just a story of an incident at that mountain.

I lived through this long long time to have revenge on those hateful bastards, but that man simply said \"That must have been tough.\" and went down the mountain. Because his face was so casual when he said that, I felt like I was nothing after hearing that. I even forgot about those bastards I hated and hated all this time.

If he cannot wield both blade and spear as he did while he lived, then all he must do is serve his Master and always be prepared for battle. No matter his Spirit Origin, he must simply dedicate himself to discharging his duty. Fan Translation: When going into life-threatening adventures, He brings the Demonic Sword Moralltach and the Demonic Spear G\u00e1e Dearg. If the danger is amount to that of time of peace, He brings the Demonic Sword Beagalltach and the Demonic Spear G\u00e1e Buidhe. It is said that by having made proper use of his equipment like that when he was alive, Diarmuid flourished as a Knight of Fianna. In that case, I wonder how would he, who wields two Demonic Swords, Perceive the current state of the world? The answer is clear. ...That is, he would live his life devotedly as a knight. If he doesn't have the swords and spears like when he was alive, He would still serve his master with the resolution of someone on a battlefield. Whatever Spirit Origin he has,  He would devote his entire body and soul to fulfill his missions.",

Tell his Imperial Highness to rely on a more respectable guy. Five, women are to return home quickly. Six, give the unneeded things like tea utensils and katana to Senchiyo. Other items will be exchanged into scrip so just do as I say. Ah, after I die, give my cherished wakizashi at Hon-ami's place in Kyoto to Senchiyo too. I don't have time for my daughter's scandalous conduct, just let her marry the doctor of the capital's commoners. My mother has to live in the capital, she has to. Even if you have to kill him, do not let Senchiyo become the successor to Kanayama Castle. Ah that's right, in by 10,000 to 1 chance, ah no 1,000,000 to 1 chance, that we suffer a crushing defeat this battle, set fire to the castle and have everyone die happily together. Tenshou 20 March 26th Morning      Musashi Nagayoshi's will that was written for a purpose. It gets absurd around the end. \"How's that, Master? I'm so devoted to my family, ain't I?\"",

Although Kagetora owned numerous swords, it is said that among them, she was particularly fond of the eight wielded treasured swords and spears that were named the protection of eight flowers. Among those, she relied the most on a spear without the maker's engraved signature. It is the one reason Kagetora, who has the aptitude to be a Saber or Rider, was summoned as a Lancer. \"By the way, you asked why I'm a Lancer? Let's see, I'm not sure if it was the right choice of words but it was this thing left undone in my past life. If I happen to meet  that  again, I think I would thoroughly smash it into smithereens until no part is left. And then, right, at that time, if I am told something like \"You lost because you are not the original Rider class...\", it would make me annoyed, so I thought I would give up on the Rider class, and left it at that.That's the reason I manifested as a Lancer.
