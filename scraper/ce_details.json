Getting hung up on them is the height of folly.\nFor this things, not dying when you get hit is enough\nBeing able to defend against a strike or two is good enough.\nWhether it's blunt, or top-class, or roughly-made, it's not a problem.\nWhy, even a crude armor can save a life, and even a blunt blade can kill. \n...But well, these were polished till they shone \nBy my subordinates and my parents and my wife and my little brother.\nI can't say anything rude about that, so I'll behave like a hero for once.\nAh, it's embarrassing, so embarrassing!\n",

Come)\u201d to return it to the hand. ---There was once when Nezha lost the possession of Universe Ring. \nIt was taken away by Lady Shiji during their battle, but eventually returned by Taiyi\u30fbZhenren.\n In order to save her parents of the human world, she commits suicide to atone for the crime she has committed. Letting go of the past as a new life reborn. The absence of this magical item is linked to the memories of humiliation and her own faults. Therefore, the Universe Ring will only be entrusted to those who have absolute trust on it. Because the Universe Ring will rely upon its partner, and will sense the emotion of its partner as if they are one entity, it is a proof that it vows to resurrect and return regardless of anything.",

        "Dialogue": "\nThis \"key\" supposedly existed in Salem, Massachusetts for a time. It was there for a few decades, but considering the key's existence is measured in centuries, that time span is just a blink of an eye. The key was methodically preserved by a thaumaturgist, who came from England. It was wrapped in parchment and then placed inside a box made out of fragrant wood that emitted a sweet-smelling aroma. The key granted special powers to the possessor. But it couldn't be in the hands of just anybody. There were specific conditions that had to be met. The conditions were that the individual had to be innocent, possess the heart of a child, and have knowledge of magecraft. This was because the key was connected to the dream world. This was due to the fact that, according to the \"Book of Eibon,\" \"Necronomicon,\" and other grimoires, the key was created by a thaumaturgist who came from the northern continent that had sunk during the Glacial Period. While it is indeed called a key since it closely resembled the excavated artifacts from the ruins of Rome, there was no lock that was paired with it. It was essentially a key based off of a concept, and it should have actually been called something similar to a staff that thaumaturgists wield. When the catastrophe that was the Witch Trials of Salem occurred, the key should have been lost and hidden away as just another myth or superstition. However, it found an individual who met the conditions to inherit it. The girl's name was Abigail Williams. The girl rightfully and correctly used the key, handed to her by the Demon God Pillar, during sunset, when the hills of the execution site turned crimson the moment the celestial bodies aligned. I\u00e4! I\u00e4! The red seal on the devil's tome inscribed by the women suspected to be witches... The same knots of the same number of nine seals were handled with the same motion fit for each seal...and the girl opened up the door that led to the \"Boundary.\" I\u00e4! I\u00e4! Y-grah'n li'gai gai! Those who gaze back on us from within the abyss of falsity. O lord of the ultimate gate who reigns beyond the corridors of dreams. O, All-in-One and One-in-All being. We must caution those who come in contact with the young girl. The girl's existence shall put the world into uncertainty. But... Oh... Ohhh... \n ...The excerpt ends there.\n Fan Translation: \n\"It is said that this \"key\" did exist, for a time, in the town of Salem, Massachusetts \u2013 in fact for several decades, although of course such a span of time is but a blink of an eye when compared to the eternal aeons to which it has borne witness. It was kept under the scrupulous charge of a so-called \"magus\" of English heritage, who wrapped it in a large sheet of parchment and stowed it away inside a box of fragrant-smelling wood. The key grants the one who bears it incredible power. It will not accept just anyone. There is a clear condition attached to its use. That condition is that the bearer must be an individual of great purity, who is accomplished in magic, but still retains the innocence of youth. This is because the key opens the door to the world of dreams. By perusing such grimoires as the Book of Eibon and the Necronomicon, one may surmise that it is the craftsmanship of the magi of a northern continent, which sank beneath the waves during the intense cold of the ice age in the fearful times of old. While its appearance, recalling artifacts excavated from ancient Roman ruins, has led to its being dubbed a \"key\", this moniker should not be assumed to imply the existence of a corresponding lock. It is a key primarily in concept, and in practice it is likely much more akin to a staff, of the variety that a magus might wield. When the lethal hysteria of the witch trials descended upon Salem, the key should by all rights have been obscured by a veil of falsehood and superstition and once again been lost, and it was saved from this fate only by the appearance of a suitable inheritor. The name of this girl was Abigail Williams --- At the hour of sunset, when the hill of the gallows was dyed rose-red beneath the stars, she took the key granted to her by the demon pillar in hand and turned it to its rightful purpose. I\u00e4! I\u00e4! The Red Signs, inscribed by the witch-branded within the Devil's tome! Seven twists and seven signs, and lo, with the proper motions she wound each one in turn \u2013 and so cast open the door to the Beyond! I\u00e4, i\u00e4! Y'grah'n, y'gnaiih, kn'ee! Thou who gazes back upon us from the abyss of fable! Thou who reigns beyond the corridors of dreams, the Lord of the Ultimate Gate! Thou who art all yet one and one yet all! All who would touch her must be warned \u2013 for her existence makes of the world itself a passing dream! But ah, ahh-\n - Note abruptly ends here.\"\n",

As Hokusai passed away in the same year at the age of ninety, this painting is often considered one of the Hokusai's very last. \nAfter he completed the \"Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji\" at age seventy, his passion for art didn't fade as he continued to create. He went so far as to dismiss his creations before the \"Thirty-Six Views\" as worthless doodles. It is said he started to grasp the essence of all animal's skeletal structures and the secret of life for all plants at the age of 73. By eighty, he had furthered his understanding of all things in nature. By ninety, he had reached enlightenment. Had he lived to one hundred years old, his skill might have reached the realm of the divine. By one hundred and ten, he could have made his paintings come alive. \nArtists of his time understood the rising dragon over Mt. Fuji to be an auspicious sign, one that signifies a person's rise to success. However, one can also see Hokusai's endless conviction in this painting. Even as he sensed his own end, he did not give in to despair and continued his endless pursuit of artistic heights none before him had ever attained.\n Fan Translation: \n\"If only Heaven will give me \njust another five more years, \nthen I could have become a real artisan.\" \n~Katsushika Hokusai's last words~ \n\"The Dragon of Smoke Escaping from Mount Fuji\" is considered to be Hokusai's last painting, who died in 1849.  \nHokusai, who completed the \"Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji\" at the age of over 70 years old, continued to passionately draw art. It was even said that any art prior to this, he considered negligible and counted for nothing. At the age of 73, he understood the structure of plants and animals, improved upon them at age 80, and mastered them at age 90; at age 100, he would go beyond the level of the gods. And some decades after that, he could have drawn a single dot, a single line as if it were alive---. \nThe dragon that climbs beyond Mount Fuji and to the heavens is seen as an auspicious symbol of success, but it can also be seen as a symbol of Hokusai's unrelenting determination. Even after realizing his own lifespan, he never accepted it; Hokusai's will to reach the heights where no man ever stood is felt here.\n",

Auntie and Medea Lily! \nThey said they were going to convert it into a\nkitchen so they could make confections! \nAnd they were going to call it the Witches' Kitchen,\nand it will only be open on Valentine's Day! \nWhat a nuisance. Besides, calling it the Witches'\nKitchen is a bad idea. It's like blatantly admitting\nthat the food has special properties and ingredients! \nBut then Auntie said... \n\"We, as highly celebrated witches of myth, must\ncreate and use only objects of the highest quality...\nfrom confectionary-making fools to aprons! \nIt's like just like how one must have the proper\nfeathers if one wishes to fly!\" \n...She was quite enthusiastic about it. \nJust the fact that she's spending time making\nsweets is taking away from her being a witch... \nDoesn't she realize that she's just an amateur\np\u00e2tissier at this point? \nShe even tried to persuade me to join, but I politely\ndeclined. \nEh? You think that's a shame? \nI already got involved because I lent them my\naprons? \n...Your eye is keen as ever. I confess, it's true. \nNever mind Lily, but Auntie... \nShe may not seem it, but she actually looks good no\nmatter what she wears. \nSo I may have gone a bit overboard, working\nfeverishly at my sewing machine. \nBut Auntie was a bit judgemental. She said that she\nnever knew I had such homely talents! Ugh! \nAt any rate, I'm quite proud of how cute the little\nchef coats turned out. I can't speak to the quality of\nthe pastries, but I want you to at least pay attention\nto how wonderful their outfits are. \nSince it seems I have no choice, I suppose I will let\nmy workshop go for now and just crash in some\nSaber's room. \nThat's why I'm here, Master. I have a few questions.\nAuntie's been barging into my room, day and night,\nasking me so many things. \nHere are some of the things one of mythology's\ngreatest witches has been asking of me: \n\"I want to know what Master's favorite flavor is. Do\nyou think they like it really sweet? Or would bitter\nbe better\" \n\"Are there any seasonings Master doesn't like? You\nknow, so I can balance things properly in the\nfuture..\" \n\"Now that I think about it, handmade confections\nare so lame. What do you think, Medea?\" \n\"If Master was a pig in their past life, what breed do\nyou think they'd have been? I hear there's a hybrid\nbrand of pigs called Tokyo \u25cf from Japan. Sounds\nromantic, huh? It has \u25cf in its name!\" \nWho cares about breeds... \n\"Hey Medea... I hear that Master is really traumatized\nby Valentine's Day. Even if they eat our chocolates\nwith a smile while we watch, I hear there's vomiting\nback in Master's room... Sounds like a joke, doesn't\nit? Huh?\" \n...So, there you have it. Phew. \nAnyway, it looks like Auntie's a bit occupied right\nnow and she can't come over, so she sent me here\non her behalf. Really, Lily should be doing this, not\nme. \nHonestly, Auntie is so fickle she gives me a \nheadache. Teehee. Don't you agree, Master? \nBut it does look like, in spite of herself, she's doing\nher best, so would you be so kind as to answer the\nquestions I asked? \nOh, it's fine. YOu don't need to be so formal and\nthank me...eh? \nI-I keep telling you! \nI-I-I'm Medea!!! Really! Honest! \nI-I-I-I told you when I got here! I'm not lying!!! \nHonestly, you are SO rude!!!\n",

And three cats. \nA few years back, a young couple related to the aging shop owners traveled to this land. \nIn the beginning, there were many problems. There were even fights. \nBut the young couple worked hard and earnestly. \nTheir disappointments eventually gave way to hope and security. \nLunar New Year is coming once again. \nThe shop gets quite busy, making traditional confectionary that is essential to every Chinese person living abroad. \nAnd it was then that a certain order came in. \n\"Q\u00edngr\u00e9nji\u00e9.

While praying, they recalled the discussion with the young couple. \nThey are with child, and they want the aging couple to think of a name for their unborn child. \nA lotus flower is a symbol of children and a prayer for safe childbirth. \nAfter some thought, the shop owners decide to accept the order.\n Fan Translation: \nA Valentine chocolate from Nezha. \n\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc\u30fc\u30fcIn the Chinatown of a certain foreign country's port city, a narrow alleyway separate from the vibrant main street, the pastry shop quietly resides. \nThe store was set up by man and woman, married for many a year. As well as three cats. They spent a few years relying on friends before that young couple could make it from the country. They experienced great blunders at first. There were times they fought. Even so, the young man and woman held a serious work ethic. Their dried-out disappointment eventually shifts to warm hope and relief. \nThis year, the New Year draws close once again. In making traditional sweets worthy the celebrations of the ethnic Chinese, the store is busy beyond end. During that time, the order was aimlessly dropped in. \u60c5\u4eba\u7bc0\u3001\u529f\u514b\u529b, Q\u00edngr\u00e9n ji\u00e9 Qi\u01ceok\u00e8l\u00ec. It did seem to be a request for sculpted Valentines Day chocolate. They had once sold their skills, their works being sold at a large store, but lately their eyesight was declining and they were growing distant from the trade. They wanted to decline, but the requestor was an old friend, and a troublesome one at that. Perhaps a lotus would be a rare find on Valentines day,  the thought suddenly struck him. \nVisiting the town shrine in the morning was daily routine for the shopkeeper. As he prayed, the memory crossed his heart, the memory of how the young couple once ceremonious put their hands together that night as they went into their plea. They had been blessed with a child. I want you to be her godfather, they told him. The lotus is the symbol of treasured children and safe childbirth. After careful consideration, the shopkeeper decided to take up the request.\n",

It never cracks or breaks, and it never buckles under any amount of force. \nJust as our pride as warrior maidens will last for eternity, this shield of divine iron will also last for eternity.\n Fan Translation: \n\u2026\u2026Yes.\n This shield is formed of Divine Iron. What was given to us by Odin. It is recorded in my mind that the recipe is lost in modern times.\n This is also our pride. In other words, it never cracks, never breaks, it will not yield to any force.\n As our warrior's pride is eternal, this Shield of Divine Iron is also eternal.\n",

Should the risk appear nothing more than in days of peace, take the demonic blade Beagalltach and demonic spear G\u00e1e Buidhe. It is in this way that Diarmuid was said to have used his equipment for different occasions during his life as a Knight of Fianna. Now that he wields both demonic swords, what must he think of his manifestation? \nThe answer is quite clear. He must simply continue to behave as a knight should. \nIf he cannot wield both blade and spear as he did while he lived, then all he must do is serve his Master and always be prepared for battle. No matter his Spirit Origin, he must simply dedicate himself to discharging his duty. Fan Translation: \nWhen going into life-threatening adventures, \nHe brings the Demonic Sword Moralltach and the Demonic Spear G\u00e1e Dearg. \nIf the danger is amount to that of time of peace, \nHe brings the Demonic Sword Beagalltach and the Demonic Spear G\u00e1e Buidhe. \nIt is said that by having made proper use of his equipment like that when he was alive, \nDiarmuid flourished as a Knight of Fianna. \nIn that case, I wonder how would he, who wields two Demonic Swords, \nPerceive the current state of the world? \nThe answer is clear. \n...That is, he would live his life devotedly as a knight. \nIf he doesn't have the swords and spears like when he was alive, \nHe would still serve his master with the resolution of someone on a battlefield. \nWhatever Spirit Origin he has,  \nHe would devote his entire body and soul to fulfill his missions.\n",
